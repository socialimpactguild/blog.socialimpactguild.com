The system also uses solar concentrators and heliostat mirrors to generate the required level of thermal energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, this technology could provide millions of litres of fresh water per day while being entirely carbon neutral. The resulting water can readily serve urban development, agriculture and tourism but needs secondary treatment to be drinkable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desalination process also produces salt and other minerals such as high-purity marketable Potassium Sulphate, Magnesium Hydroxide and Calcium Carbonate, relieving pressure on the nearby marine environments.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the Earth is “the blue planet,” only 3% of its water is freshwater. Over a billion people lack access to it, and demand will exceed supply by 40% in 2030 due to climate change and population growth. Moreover, the existing desalination plants rely on fossil fuels and cannot scale without worsening the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The water crisis already generates wars, deaths and irreversible damage to marine life. In this context, environmental-friendly solutions are more than welcome.

Today, his startup </span><a href="https://www.praan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Praan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to build affordable and versatile outdoor air purifiers that can fit into the existing infrastructure (e.g. street lamps). </span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovation sucks the polluting particles out of the air and collects them in a container. However, Angad’s design does not use filters, like in household air purifiers. Indeed, people would have to replace these filters every day in cities as polluted as Indian megapolis. On the other hand, Praan’s filterless purifier can operate for several months before requiring maintenance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This technology filters around nine cubic metres of air per minute and stores 11,540 cubic centimetres of pollutants. And, Praan gives the collected carbon to </span><a href="https://www.carboncraftdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon Craft Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another Indian company that uses the pollutants as pigment to create stylish decorative flooring tiles for restaurants, shops, and hotels.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">India is home to 22 of the world's 30 most polluted cities, and its toxic air kills more than one million people each year. Moreover, black carbon can absorb one million times more energy from the sun than carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming. Also, studies suggest that a PM2.5 increase of just one microgram per cubic metre corresponds to a 15% increase in </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covid-19 deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now more than ever, tackling air pollution in cities is crucial.

At the end of the training, each dog is paired with a trainer to form an elite SICS unit that saves lives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man behind this initiative, Ferruccio Pilenga, had the idea to train his dog in the late 1980s after discovering how good a swimmer he was. According to Ferrucio, his dog “pulled a water-filled dinghy with three people on board for half an hour”: a feat that no human could achieve!</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thanks to their strength, willingness to perform, and bond with their trainer, SICS dogs save around 30 lives every year. Moreover, their intensive training makes them particularly effective in life-or-death scenarios where the capabilities of one or two lifeguards might be easily overwhelmed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy is currently the only country to recognize canine lifeguards officially. However, SICS is setting up training centres in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Spain to spread its knowledge and ensure safer waters worldwide.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/italys-lifesaving-dogs-swim-towards-foreign-shores-h26bf7v0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thetimes.co.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">⚽ The </span><a href="https://www.fgr.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest Green Rovers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the world’s first </span><a href="https://www.fgr.co.uk/another-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carbon-neutral soccer club</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a 100% renewable-energy powered stadium, a fertilizer-free lawn and a vegan-only menu for the fans.
