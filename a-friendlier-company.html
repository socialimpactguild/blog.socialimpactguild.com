These eye-opening experiences, notably in the Scandinavian countries, inspired them to use reverse logistics to create "a solid process that would enable the reuse of packaging".<br><br>Launched less than six months ago, amid the pandemic, A Friendlier Company has already rapidly expanded to support several Ontarian areas thanks to the support of the people who have "rallied behind the foodservice businesses in our program," she says. As a result, Kayli explains they have raised "over 5,000 containers that are equivalent to diverting 600 pounds of waste from landfill".Â <br><br>For the years to come, they keep in mind that they want to "create a system for the average consumer and not just people who are [interested] in sustainability" to broaden their impact. So, they envision further expansion across Ontario to reach more people.<br><br>To support them, you can ask your favourite restaurants and takeout places for reusables! You can also join their social media platforms and download their app to find locations using their system readily.</p><h2>Insights into Kick-starting a Social Venture</h2><h3>Finding the Idea</h3><p>"Find a problem that you are passionate about. It is not an easy journey! If you do not feel incredibly passionate about what you are doing, and if it does not give you the motivation to keep going, it is going to be tough.", Kayli underlines.</p><p>The idea is to make sure to "choose a problem that<strong> needs solving</strong>," and you are willing to put the effort in to solve it.</p><h3>First Steps</h3><p>Kayli believes it is crucial always to be adaptable and <strong>resilient</strong>. A Friendlier Company faced two significant obstacles at the beginning:</p><ul><li><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Being constantly <strong>rejected</strong>; and</span></li><li>Targeting large event venues and having to deal with COVID-19 (e.g. large unsold inventory).</li></ul><p>However, they <strong>adjusted quickly </strong>to the changes taking place in the market and "built a system that would work during the pandemic" and would tackle the ongoing increase in takeout waste. They also adopted an iterative and focused approach that helped them move forward.</p><p>Moreover, Kayli highlights that "every piece of [their] process was a big undertaking," and they leveraged their previous <strong>exposure </strong>to the startup world and experiences to design this process. According to her, other essential factors to the company's success include:</p><ul><li>Applying to many programs;</li><li><strong>Networking </strong>with as many people as possible; and</li><li>Being willing to change your mind about your ideas.</li></ul><h3>Scaling-up</h3><p>Raising equity enables growth and scaling-up quickly to make a significant impact, Kayli explains. A Friendlier Company won funding through programs first, then small equity fundraising and now they are contemplating opening up their pre-seed.</p><p>They also work with a few groups from various universities (from engineering to marketing) and are hiring co-ops students to give back to the programs that initially helped them. Also, they look for people who "<strong>understand the problem</strong> <strong>they are trying to address and</strong> <strong>feel passionate about solving it</strong>" through conferences and networking events, for instance.</p><h2><strong>Inspiration to Go!</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Do not be afraid of starting your venture and taking that step to work towards a solution to something you are passionate about! There are so many important problems out there that are not getting enough attention, especially in the social impact area.</p><p>Those areas can still be profitable, and they need businesses and smart people to come in and work on those problems and build up those markets. It is an extremely fun and exciting journey, and I do not think you will regret it!<br><br></p></blockquote></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 24, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fa-friendlier-company.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fa-friendlier-company.html&amp;via=nphumbert&amp;text=A%20Friendlier%20Company" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fa-friendlier-company.html&amp;title=A%20Friendlier%20Company" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/website/nadia.png" loading="lazy" alt="Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz"><div><h3><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/authors/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz/" class="invert" rel="author">Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz</a></h3><p>Entrepreneur, consultant, biosciences and software engineer, working on projects enabling positive impact.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments"><div class="post__inner"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
