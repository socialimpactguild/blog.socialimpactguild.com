Traditionally, jewellers let Nature do this part and extract diamonds directly from the Earth. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aether flipped the script and developed a process to create diamonds from air pollution, effectively removing carbon from the air for each carat they produce. Moreover, the company achieved an overall carbon-negative footprint by using only renewable and low-emission sources throughout the process.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, a two-carat ring will offset roughly 40 metric tonnes of carbon emissions, corresponding to two and a half years of a typical American person’s emissions.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted by movies like “Blood Diamond,” traditional diamond production enables human exploitation, conflicts and environmental devastation. In terms of global warming alone, the diamond trade is responsible for at least 12 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its game-changing technology, Aether offers a conflict-free and eco-friendly alternative that features the same physical, chemical and optical characteristics as ‘traditional’ diamonds.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">🧽 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/furniture-made-from-eelgrass-good-for-the-environment-and-your-health.html">The Furniture That Cleans Your Home</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/eelgrass.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/eelgrass-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/eelgrass-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/eelgrass-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="798" height="449"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish startup </span><a href="https://www.sould.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produces eco-friendly building materials from eelgrass.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of eelgrass as a building material dates back 400 years ago when Danish folks were using this highly available sea plant as a roofing material. After ten years of research and development, Søuld adapted that traditional building technique into a modern process that leverages the eelgrass’ CO2-binding properties to create furniture that also serves as a carbon sink.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, this highly fashionable, recyclable and non-toxic furniture creates a healthier indoor environment. Indeed, it dampens noise and provides acoustic comfort, and absorbs and releases moisture without rotting to create a healthy indoor climate free from bacteria, mould and other microbes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, these products offer thermal insulation, resistance to fire and can last more than 150 years, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated that indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, leading to asthma, decreased lung function and heart issues. And, with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, indoor air quality is even more crucial.</span></p><p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on our location, the weather can generate humid conditions, breeding mould in our home. In this context, investing in a dehumidifier can go a long way to creating a healthier environment.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our homes usually feature many filters that help us eliminate pollutants, dust and allergens. However, we should make sure to change the filter of our vacuum cleaner, clothes dryer, kitchen vent and AC regularly to ensure their proper functioning – especially if we live in a metropolitan area with high pollution levels.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we can leverage nature and install a few indoor plants to clean our environment while improving our mood and enhancing our home décor. Small plants like ferns and lilies and larger palm trees are the best options to pull contaminants out of the air. However, be careful about potential allergies before your next trip to your local florist!</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld’s approach respects the cultural heritage of eelgrass while meeting the design and environmental needs of today.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/japan-wants-to-harness-the-energy-of-super-typhoons-to-reach-climate-goals.html">The Guild’s Pick</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/typhoon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese "Typoonshot" project aims to mitigate typhoon-related risks and harness their energy to help the country reach zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the brand new Typhoon Science and Technology Research Center at </span><a href="https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/" target="null"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yokohama National University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers, analysts and experts are working together to find ways to reduce the damage typhoons cause and collect the massive amount of clean energy they generate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the project is only at the beginning, experts already consider many methods to achieve its goals. The first experiment they hope to conduct soon involves injecting large amounts of ice into the storm's eye to reduce its overall pressure and intensity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea is to deploy a fleet of remote-controlled ships into a storm that gathers and stores energy from wind and undersea turbines. In fact, according to their estimation, the energy of a single powerful typhoon could meet the global demand for energy for an entire month!</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, mainland Japan is relatively safe from super typhoons. However, the country already suffers from "regular" typhoons, and climate change is likely to send more powerful ones in the years to come. Also, Japan's access to energy sources is limited, and many worry about the country's zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harnessing a super typhoon's energy seems like a highly challenging task. However, success in such a game-changing endeavour would completely change how we see typhoons.
