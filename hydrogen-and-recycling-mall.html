Let us know what you think!</em></p><p>In the past few weeks, British Columbia witnessed the worst floods in recorded history, leading to the evacuation of nearly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/flooding-mudslides-bc-by-the-numbers-1.6252453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 people</a> and $1 billion in damages. Also, two weeks after the first rainfalls, Vancouver is still virtually inaccessible by road from the rest of the country—forcing the government to impose <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/natural-disaster/support/restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">restrictions</a> on fuel and travel.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong> Nowadays, floods create more damage than before because of a combination of factors.</p><ol><li>Forests can naturally slow water down, absorb it and release it gradually over several days. But, <strong>human intervention</strong> remodelled the landscape and replaced these forests with paved areas that redirect water straight into rivers and lakes, overflowing them in the process.</li><li>The <strong>growing population</strong> led to the creation of entire neighbourhoods in areas with a significant risk of flooding. Each flood can also affect more people since urban areas are denser and denser.</li><li>As a result, floods would be more serious even without climate change. However, <strong>global warming</strong> also plays its part by evaporating more water from the ocean and letting the warmer atmosphere hold a greater volume of water, increasing rainfalls' intensity. Moreover, droughts make the soil extremely dry and compact—impeding its ability to absorb and retain water.</li></ol><p>In a nutshell, global warming worsens the rainfalls, and many factors reduce the land's ability to drain water properly. In British Columbia, the main causes for these extreme floods include the proximity to the ocean, intensive logging, and having drained the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumas_Lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sumas Lake</a> artificially to create fertile farmlands 100 years ago. Last week, the overflow from the nearby rivers refilled the Sumas Lake, as anticipated by a <a href="https://www.abbotsford.ca/sites/default/files/2021-02/Nooksack%20Overflow%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 report</a>.</p><p>With work from home becoming more pervasive, we don't necessarily need to live in urban areas anymore—helping us build a world more resilient towards floods.</p><h2>🚀 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/german-startup-makes-green-hydrogen-accessible-to-everyone.html">The Device That Produces Green Hydrogen From Water</a></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/122/hydrogen-use-case-wide.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/122/responsive/hydrogen-use-case-wide-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/122/responsive/hydrogen-use-case-wide-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/122/responsive/hydrogen-use-case-wide-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="2559" height="1439"></figure>The German startup <a href="https://www.enapter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enapter</a> designed an <a href="https://www.enapter.com/press-release/enapter-wins-the-earthshot-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">award-winning</a> technology that makes emission-free hydrogen accessible to all.<p></p><p>Vaitea Cowan, the co-founder, was born in New Caledonia, where climate change—the sea-level rise in particular—is a pressing existential threat to the entire population.
