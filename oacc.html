My name is Marveh Farhoodi, I am Iranian and immigrated to Canada a couple of years ago. I am a human-centred designer at <a href="http://openarchcollab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OACC </a>and community-based tourism specialist at Ethnomad, and I am passionate about supporting local initiatives that care for people, land and rules through a participatory approach to enable equitably shared social outcomes.</p><p>I am the Program Director at OACC, which is a collaborative of socially-minded designers, architects, planners, community leaders, creators and innovators who got together with the mission to connect good design and socially-minded designers with members of underserved communities in the Greater Toronto Area to advocate for positive changes in the building of their neighbourhoods.</p><p>For the past one and a half year, we have been transitioning the culture and strategic approach of OACC, from an exclusively volunteer-run organisation and project-based mindset to a mission-centric start-up that incubates change-making ideas via an inclusive community-engaged process.</p><p>We are hoping that, in a couple of years, we could be a social hub for socially-minded designers and planners to incubate their ideas for more resilient cities and neighbourhoods in Canada.<br><br><strong>Do you proactively seek for projects or do people reach out to you for your services?</strong><br><br>We are reaching out ourselves to codify projects. In the long term, we are hoping that we would be able to incubate projects as well.<br><br><strong>Do you work on projects from scratch or do you also intervene in on-going projects?</strong></p><p>It is a really challenging process for us, that is why we try to engage in projects from scratch. However, if we even have to jump in the middle of a project, we also appreciate it because we want to raise awareness around our approach to architecture. We know that it is a long journey so we take every opportunity to show that this participatory approach should be authentic, meaningful and inclusive. </p><blockquote><p>The human-centred design tries to come to a collective solution by engaging the relevant people in the process to understand their desires and needs.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Can you talk more about the details of the human-centred design process?</strong><br><br>The human-centred design is an approach that is used to understand social challenges. It tries to come to a collective solution by engaging the relevant people in the process to understand their desires and needs. These people should be at the center of creating as well, and not just providing inputs.<br><br><strong>The human-centred design process contains five steps: Framing, Empathising, Synthesis, Concepting and Prototyping. I know that the two first steps involve collecting primary and secondary data. Can you tell more about these steps?</strong><br><br>Framing is about understanding what is the capacity of the team vis-<span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">à</span></span>-vis the resources we have, and defining our assets, budget and time - based on a discovery stage. It is about clearly defining the available resources we have to work on a specific project. This step's inputs are a broad definition of the project as well as secondary data.</p><p>Empathising is about learning from your context.</p><blockquote><p>[To collect primary data], we have diverse techniques and tools based on live interactions between local stakeholders and specialists.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What are the techniques that you use to collect your primary data during the second step?</strong><br><br>We use one-on-one or small group interviews, but we seek co-creation at the centre of our research so we will not be satisfied by just interviewing. Thus, we will also have community meetings and workshops to envision what we want to work on in a more visual and creative way. These interactions are more insightful in terms of understanding people's point of view and desires.</p><p>Also, we use surveys, focus groups, and collaboration between focus and research groups. In summary, we have diverse techniques and tools based on live interactions between local stakeholders and specialists.<br><br><strong>How do you make sure to get everyone's inputs and engagement during a focus group?</strong><br><br>We start by a self-reflection about our own biases and baggage to avoid making assumptions and to be fully open to other people's perspectives from a neutral standpoint. Then, we make sure to keep this mindset throughout the entire process. Also, we let them know that everyone should feel comfortable with sharing their thoughts and feelings about whether something is not going well. If so, we say "okay, we need a pause, let's reflect together as a group".</p><blockquote><p>What we do can create a momentum for changes. These small interventions let communities share their ideas for their neighbourhoods, as well as create collaborative momentum for more systemic changes.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Overall, what effects have you seen in the communities as a result of your initiatives?</strong></p><p>In Toronto, we did a community conversation session to revisit the planning of a neighbourhood which was heavily impacted by gentrification. A motion has then been started to make sure that this neighbourhood's cultural identity will be preserved in the community.<br><br>What we do can create a momentum for changes. These small interventions let communities share their ideas for their neighbourhoods, as well as create collaborative momentum for more systemic changes, creating more equitable quality of public spaces.<br><br><strong>I think that what you are doing is crucial to generate fit-for-purpose projects that will have long lasting impact in the communities. It is a prerequisite to build inclusive, resilient and sustainable communities as well.</strong></p><p><strong>Otherwise, how has the pandemic affected what you are doing?</strong></p><p>We had a lot projects, funding and partnerships ready to go but everything stopped as a result of COVID-19. We actually use this context as an opportunity to build our own capacity by expanding our network, as well as raising awareness among architectural planning students and young professionals.</p><p>We are now working on a scalable idea, which is a sharing platform between different socially-minded designers and planners who want to learn more about practical aspects of community-engaged design and planning. This academy would allow us to generate a new revenue stream. However, we are not able to initiate something more tangible because many people do not have access to internet nor have digital literacy.<br><br><strong>Yes, it would not be inclusive and your data would consequently be biased. Indeed, you would be excluding all the people without the resources to work online. </strong></p><p><strong>Today, how can people support OACC?</strong></p><p>We always welcome volunteers that are aligned with our purpose. We would also benefit from funding and sponsoring for the projects. Finally, if you are interested in learning about what we do through our workshops, we would be more than happy to provide that service to you.</p><blockquote><p>Communities that have been relying on local tourism exclusively have been economically devastated during the pandemic. It is about maintaining diversity of income and resources rather than economically relying on only one revenue stream.</p></blockquote><p><strong>I would like to learn more about your work as a project consultant at Ethnomad. Is there anything that people tend to ignore about the effect of tourism on the communities that you would like to raise awareness about?</strong></p><p>I have been working as a freelance consultant for a while and would love to do more to share the stories of the communities, as you are doing for social entrepreneurs.<br>I took my second Master in sustainable tourism management and we learned that, whenever you are going to start a project in a community, the first thing to do is to make sure that tourism is the last thing that they try to establish. So, imagine our shock for us as students in tourism!</p><p>Now, we can clearly see why, since all the communities that have been relying on local tourism exclusively, have been economically devastated during the pandemic. So, you should not put all the eggs in one basket. For every project, we should talk about the negative effects that a tourism initiative might have on the community, and identify a set of products and services that can be readily shifted. It is about maintaining diversity of income and resources rather than economically relying on only one revenue stream.<br><br><strong>Is there anything else that you would like to share with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong></p><p>Yes! OACC is a collaborative so I am just talking as a representative today. It is all about collective leadership and a group of people trying to realise a shared vision!</p><hr><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-1.jpg" data-size="800x473"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="426"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-2.jpg" data-size="945x756"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="576"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-3.jpg" data-size="2048x1363"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-3-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="479"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-4.jpg" data-size="2048x1363"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-4-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="479"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-5.jpg" data-size="504x378"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-5-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="378"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-6.jpg" data-size="1080x809"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/12/gallery/image-6-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="539"></a></figure></div></div><p>Thanks so much for reading this post, I hope you enjoyed it!</p><p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to chat with me, feel free to reach out to me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>! </p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 27, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Foacc.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Foacc.html&amp;via=nphumbert&amp;text=Human-Centred%20Design%20with%20OACC" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Foacc.html&amp;title=Human-Centred%20Design%20with%20OACC" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/tags/interview/">Interview</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/website/nadia.png" loading="lazy" alt="Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz"><div><h3><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/authors/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz/" class="invert" rel="author">Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz</a></h3><p>Entrepreneur, consultant, bio-sciences and software engineer, working on projects to effect social impact.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments"><div class="post__inner"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
