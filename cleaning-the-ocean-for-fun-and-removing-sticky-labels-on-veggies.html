The mark is invisible once the skin is removed and doesn’t affect shelf life or eating quality. The cost of a laser machine is considerable, but this technique is significantly more cost-effective than stickers after this initial investment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, ICA is only targeting organic products because environmental awareness heavily drives organic sales. However, the stakeholders hope to expand it to other products to scale this innovation’s environmental impact.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By using this laser technique on organic avocados only, ICA will save 200km of 30cm-wide plastic each year! Moreover, it generates less than 1% of the carbon emissions needed to produce stickers. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the million stickers used worldwide every day, this innovative technology could reduce the usage of paper, ink and glue while cutting greenhouse gas emissions significantly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Source: theguardian.com)</span></p><h2 id="game"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎮 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/this-game-lets-you-clean-up-the-ocean-for-fun.html">The Video Game That Cleans the Oceans</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/33/turtle.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/33/responsive/turtle-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/33/responsive/turtle-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/33/responsive/turtle-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1918" height="1079"></figure><a href="https://www.enderocean.com/default/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ender Ocean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the first online game dedicated to cleaning up the oceans. This French company features an innovative satellite-based photo analysis technology that detects ocean areas where waste has accumulated and remotely operated robots that pick up the waste underwater. These robots are operated by... online players!</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By subscribing to the website, you get access to training sessions to familiarize yourself with the robot in swimming pools. You are then ready to participate in real-life operations, and Ender Ocean regularly opens slots in identified areas needing some cleaning to showcase your piloting skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being an online game in 2021, these cleaning sessions are, of course, live-streamed on Twitch, and players can compare scores with each other. The cherry on the cake is that the company shares all the pictures and collected information as open data to increase our common knowledge of the oceans 🤩</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> The world produces 10 tonnes of plastic each second. Since 1950, 9 billion tonnes of plastic have accumulated in the ocean, creating a 1.6 million square kilometres drifting “continent.” This plastic would take more than 1,000 years to decompose, notably affecting biodiversity, contaminating our seafood and depleting our natural resources.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ender Ocean found an innovative way to collect and recycle plastic that is fun, competitive and extremely current.

The idea is to collect water from waterways and extract organic material containing the DNA from animals nearby.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arnaud led a team that demonstrated that eDNA analysis of stream water could reveal terrestrial mammals' diversity in a large landscape as effectively as camera trapping -- for a fraction of the cost!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, this technique can empower local communities and organizations to take control of biodiversity monitoring since it does not require specialized skills.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Traditionally, scientists have monitored mammal species by catching and tagging animals or placing camera traps throughout their habitat. However, these techniques are time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. Indeed, species of interest, such as small mammals, do not necessarily trigger cameras, and it can be challenging to identify them in the pictures. Finding ways to improve wildlife monitoring accuracy is vital since conservation efforts are based on knowing which animals are present and where they live.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, eDNA can help us better understand biodiversity and thus make better decisions to preserve it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Source: news.mongabay.com)</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🚧 The French startup </span><a href="https://neolithe.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Néolithe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transforms non-recyclable waste into construction aggregate.
