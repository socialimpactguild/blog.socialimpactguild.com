If you watched the amazing TV show “New Amsterdam,” you might already be familiar with the initiative we’ll present now 😊</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lorenzo Lewis wanted to leverage this relationship and founded the </span><a href="https://www.theconfessproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confess Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As part of this project, he opened the first mental health barbershop in the US. The idea is to train barbers to be mental health advocates and pick up on signs of when their clients are going through rough patches. </span></p><p>Engaging in a conversation and providing support can go a long way towards building a positive culture for young men of colour, boys and their families, and changing assumptions about mental health.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/confess_project.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/confess_project-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/confess_project-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/confess_project-md.jpg 768w" alt="@theconfessproject | Facebook" width="2050" height="780"></figure><p>90% of the clients involved in this project indicated they would rather receive therapy through their barbershop than go into a therapy clinic. To be fair, if you get mental health support from trained people and a rad haircut on top of it, it’s a pretty sweet combo 😎</p><p>Tens of millions of people struggle with mental health in the US, so this movement has naturally reached virtually every part of the country. Their goal is to train 1,000 barbers by the end of the year. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health doesn’t have to be taboo. Initiatives like this are essential, and we hope that we will find other innovative ways to support our amazing youth and help it thrive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: thedenverchannel.com)</span></p><h2 id="ramps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🧱 The Grandmother Who Builds Wheelchair Ramps From LEGO Bricks</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since LEGO introduced its little bricks to the world, they have never ceased to amaze and spark creativity among kids and adults.</span></p><p>Rita Ebel is a 62-years old grandmother using LEGO bricks to build wheelchair ramps in her German hometown of Hanau. For each ramp, she uses several hundreds of bricks, stuck together with up to eight tubes of glue. Given how hard it can be to separate bricks from each other (we have sore fingers just thinking about it), we’ll let you imagine how solid the ramps are with all this glue 😂</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/lego-ramps.webp" alt="" width="814" height="522"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita is in a wheelchair since a car accident 25 years ago, and she was excited to witness the positive reactions around her creations. In addition to their utilitarian value, they bring a joyful atmosphere into this small town.</span></p><p>Businesses are thrilled to set them up as disabled people can see from afar that the shop is accessible. Also, the colourful tiny bricks attract people of all ages, who never miss a chance to take pictures.</p><p>Of course, there is more! Rita’s idea has sparked interest worldwide. She has sent ramp building instructions to Austria and Switzerland. She is also in contact with a school in the United States and people from Spain. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to her creativity, some plastic bricks and a lot of glue, she managed to tackle an issue that she was facing directly while raising awareness about accessibility.
