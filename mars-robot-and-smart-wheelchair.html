ELU runs on solar energy and is particularly adapted to dry environments with relatively high humidity levels, like Mars or some deserts on Earth. Indeed, on Mars, humidity can reach 100% during nighttime while it can peak at 50% in the </span><a href="https://sciencing.com/humidity-mojave-desert-19526.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mojave desert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using polymer technology, ELU condenses moisture in the air. Then it filters, sterilizes, and enhances the resulting water to make it drinkable. According to Mahmoud, the cost of generating water from the air is lower than any other available technology. Indeed, one litre of water costs 1.5 to 2 cents with ELU, against 20 cents with other technologies such as wells or river extensions.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate change causes the progressive desertification of the globe, and fresh water is more and more scarce. Mahmoud claims that his innovation is extremely scalable and that he can launch plants that generate 5,000 or even 50,000 litres per day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn’t be the first time that a technology designed for space exploration had ended up </span><a href="https://www.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/philips-space/space/10-space-innovations-that-are-closer-than-you-think.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefitting people on Earth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Founded by four students from </span><a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH Zurich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.zhdk.ch/en/zurich-university-of-the-arts-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zurich University of the Arts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company won several design awards for its smart wheelchair. </span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can operate the chair through an integrated touch interface or a smartphone and choose different modes: park, drive, and track mode. The latter enables more fine-grained control, letting users climb stairs, reach higher shelves at homes or be at eye level to others. In addition, according to Scewo, the technology ensures the seat balances itself to stay in a sitting position without the risk of tipping over.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Scewo Bro can go up to 10 kph and has a battery autonomy of 35 km. It can also fit in the trunk of a car and requires 5 hours to charge fully.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independence in mobility is a critical determinant of quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Today, </span><a href="https://www.inclusivecitymaker.com/disabled-people-in-the-world-in-2021-facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">75 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worldwide need a wheelchair daily. With increased longevity and ageing baby boomers, this number will likely grow in the years to come.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the world should become more accessible for people with mobility disabilities, this wheelchair will increase their mobility and thus provide them with a better quality of life. </span></p><h2> </h2><h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/39/school.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/39/responsive/school-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/39/responsive/school-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/39/responsive/school-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1099" height="619"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fianarantsoa, Madagascar, </span><a href="https://www.thinkinghuts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking Hut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnered with architectural design agency </span><a href="https://studiomortazavi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Mortazavi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Finnish company </span><a href="https://www.hyperionrobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyperion Robotics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create the world’s first 3D-printed school.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the organization, 3D printing uses less concrete than other methods, and this 3D cement mixture emits less carbon dioxide than traditional concrete. As a result, building a new school in under a week is possible while minimizing the related environmental impact. Among other benefits, this innovation employs locally sourced materials and generates less waste by building objects layer by layer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this project, Thinking Huts aims to widen access to education and address the lack of investment in physical infrastructure, one of the main contributors to the low education rate in Madagascar. </span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The absence of educational buildings is a massive impediment in many countries, especially those lacking labour and building resources. This issue will be particularly crucial in a post-pandemic world. Indeed, UNICEF estimated that 1.6 billion children worldwide are in danger of </span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/keeping-worlds-children-learning-through-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">falling behind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they don’t have access to the Internet or proper devices to receive online education.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting children back in the classrooms will, therefore, be key to ensure proper education everywhere.
