Hi, I am Pratiksha Pandey I am from Nepal and I have been working in this field for five years. Also, I am currently working as a mentor for the <a href="https://www.nyas.org/programs/global-stem-alliance/1000-girls-1000-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"1000 Girls, 1000 Futures" program</a> for the New York Academy of Science and I am leading the organisation Smart Cheli (<em>Smart Daughter</em>) here in Nepal. Smart Cheli is an organisation that provides STEAM education to young girls. We provide STEAM workshops and mentorship. In the STEAM workshops, we involve the young girls in project-based learning in our space. During the mentorship program, we connect them with mentors based on their interests. We also provide STEAM workshops in schools as extracurricular activities.</p><blockquote><p>There is no gender-based subject. It's all up to you. It's all up to your interest.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why did you start this organisation? What was the motivation behind it?</strong><br>When I was in college, I was doing a Bachelor in Electronics and Communications Engineering - and we were three girls. Before that, a lot of people were saying that engineering is not for girls - and that it is hard for them. But, in my classroom, we were three girls, doing the same things than boys, and getting the same marks, so it didn't make sense! That made me feel like that there is no gender-based subject. It's all up to you. It's all up to your interest. These are stereotypes that make us feel that we are less capable. So, many girls are falling behind and not joining these fields because of these stereotypes. I think that, to avoid this, we need to go back to the schools, increase awareness among young girls and make them feel they are not less capable.<br><br><strong>What have been your most exciting achievements or experiences during your social entrepreneurship journey?</strong> <br>Before Smart Cheli, I was engaged with <a href="https://www.wistemnepal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women In STEM</a> in Nepal. When I was working with that organisation, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.cledepeau-beaute.com/int/powerofradiance-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power of Radiance Award 2020</a> for the work in the field of education. That is not such a big achievement because there are so many things yet to achieve but this award recognised our work around the globe. Yes, that was the happiest moment in my life!</p><blockquote><p>We are human beings, we want to face people when we talk to them.</p></blockquote><p><strong>How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact your organisation?</strong><br>Yes, COVID has had an impact because some of the schools are opening, but many are still closed. So, we are not going back to the schools and now, we are just doing virtual sessions for girls. We are not able to bring them in our space and watch their performance by ourselves. It makes everything more monotonous. We are human beings, we want to face people when we talk to them. The pandemic make things a little bit complicated, but it will pass and things will go back to the way they were before.<br><br><strong>Prior to COVID-19, what other challenges have you faced as a social entrepreneur? </strong><br>Before the pandemic, we were planning to reach out to programs in other districts in Nepal and reach out to more girls that do not have access to STEAM education. These plans are postponed for now, but we will resume them after the situation becomes normal again.<br><br><strong>What is your vision for the years to come? Also, do you generate revenues to sustain your purpose or do you rely solely on donations and government grants?</strong><br>Currently, we are sustained by grants and we are also planning to be self-sustained. It is not possible to be entirely self-sustained but we are planning to generate some revenues, from our workshops for instance, that will help us in some way. We are also looking to collaborate with local government to reach more people, and seeking other grants or applying for not-for-profit organisation programs. We are trying to make everything more effective and sustainable.<br><br><strong>How would you define a social enterprise?</strong><br>Yes, there are lots of definitions for it. And also, they can be different in different countries. At first, I was thinking that a social enterprise is an enterprise that serves society in some way and takes money from it, which will help grow the organisation. However, in Nepal, that definition is slightly wrong because here a social enterprise is just a company which uses grants and cannot make profit. It's not a profit-making company but we can use revenues to organise and manage our office.</p><blockquote><p>Let's spread positivity and inspire more people around the world!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Would like to share anything else with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong><br>Let's spread positivity and inspire more people around the world!</p><hr><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/What-is-STEM.png" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/What-is-STEM-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/girls.jpg" data-size="2048x1365"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/girls-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/classroom.JPG" data-size="5184x3456"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/classroom-thumbnail.JPG" alt="" width="720" height="480"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/classroom-2.JPG" data-size="5184x3456"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/classroom-2-thumbnail.JPG" alt="" width="720" height="480"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/testimonial-1.png" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/testimonial-1-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/testimonial-2.png" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/testimonial-2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/workshop.jpg" data-size="2048x1448"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/workshop-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="509"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/virtual-session.jpg" data-size="1920x905"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/3/gallery/virtual-session-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="339"></a></figure></div></div><p>Thanks so much for reading this post, I hope you enjoyed it!
