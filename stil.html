Hillary, only one year later, turned her frustration with the inaccessibility of built-in environments and the inability to participate in sustainability initiatives into business opportunities.</p><p>Her social enterprise intends to bridge the gap between sustainability and accessibility in the area of waste management. It provides organizations with WasteFinder, a shape-and-colour-based waste management system for public spaces, accessible to people of all abilities.</p><p>STIL Solutions has already been working with 18 customers across Ontario, creating more inclusive spaces for people with vision loss, people living with blindness, children or even people who do not speak the native language where they live yet. It also contributes to the standardization of waste management.</p><p>The end goal is to "empower everyone to be a steward of their environment and divert as much waste as possible from landfill." For the years to come, they want to make all public spaces accessible to people of all abilities from a sustainability perspective.<br><br>To support STIL Solutions, follow them on Instagram and check out their website. You can also spread the word about their initiative and contact them if you want to implement their solution!</p><h2 class="align-left">Insights Into Turning Barriers Into Business Opportunities</h2><h3>Barrier Identification</h3><p>It comes down to understanding the behaviours necessary for the cause you want to participate in (e.g. being more environmentally friendly) and asking yourself whether everyone can participate to that cause, regardless of their ability.</p><p>By applying this approach to your context, you can turn barriers into business opportunities by removing them. "It is important to recognize these gaps and act upon them," Hillary underlines.</p><h3>Acknowledging Some Potential Challenges</h3><p>Sometimes, technology might not always be the answer to your problem. For instance, Hillary wants to address the accessibility of built-in environments to participate in sustainability initiatives and did not want to "place the responsibility of accessibility on the individual with the disability to have data on their phone and download an app".</p><p>However, it might become more challenging to access funding without it. Also, when tapping into something innovative, it might become imperative to spend time and resources educating people, to "build credibility and succeed", instead of focusing solely on growing. Also, men dominate the startup world in North America. </p><p>For these reasons, it can be easy to burn out while running a low-tech social enterprise as a woman.</p><h3>Ideas To Help You Thrive</h3><p>We uncovered a set of factors that might help you thrive, despite the difficulties.</p><p>First, it is crucial to understand that you need to <strong>enjoy the process</strong> and not only the end goal itself. So, make sure to put systems in place to enjoy your entrepreneurial journey and take care of yourself along the way. </p><p>Also, having a clear<strong> understanding </strong>of what you are trying to achieve is necessary to ensure your actions are always aligned with your objectives and avoid strategic drift.</p><p>Finally, constant and ongoing <strong>communication</strong> with the community and stakeholders is essential. Hillary highlights that "people with disabilities with diverse backgrounds and experiences" informed all of her business decisions. She indicates this has allowed her to ensure her products will make a real impact. So, be always open to expanding your network and gathering feedback.</p><h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2><blockquote><p>Disability is one of the only marginalized identities that we are all going to experience at some point in our lives because of injuries, temporary illnesses, age, among others. So, even if you think that this might not apply to you now, it is within everyone's best interest to make the environment more accessible.</p></blockquote><hr><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 30, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fstil.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fstil.html&amp;via=nphumbert&amp;text=Turning%20Barriers%20Into%20Business%20Opportunities%20w%2F%20STIL%20Solutions" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fstil.html&amp;title=Turning%20Barriers%20Into%20Business%20Opportunities%20w%2F%20STIL%20Solutions" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/website/nadia.png" loading="lazy" alt="Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz"><div><h3><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/authors/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz/" class="invert" rel="author">Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz</a></h3><p>Entrepreneur, consultant, biosciences and software engineer, working on projects enabling positive impact.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments"><div class="post__inner"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
