<p>These pioneer farmers in the Pyrenees produce bananas, turmeric, passionfruit, mangos, and many other species that we usually find in La Réunion (a French department in the Indian Ocean). Their secret is to find species that can handle conditions colder than the tropics to flourish in European greenhouses.</p>
<p>Moreover, Les Arts Verts grow their food according to the organic certification ECOCERT. In particular, they cultivate their tropical produce in living spaces, using polyculture to keep the soil rich and increase biodiversity. Also, they do not heat their greenhouses but equip them with solar panels to put clean electricity back into the grid.</p>
<p>Finally, this farm collaborates with the greatest French chefs—including a Michelin-starred restaurant— to provide them with zero-carbon exotic products.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Bananas and mangos are among the preferred fruits in France. The country imports <a href="https://www.fruitlogistica.com/FRUIT-LOGISTICA/Downloads-Alle-Sprachen/Auf-einen-Blick/European_Statistics_Handbook_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3.4 million metric tons of fruit</a> every year, despite the vast amount of farms within its borders. However, importing 2 tons of products can generate 6 tons of carbon dioxide and its greenhouse gas equivalent.</p>
<p>Eco-conscious consumers in France will now be able to get their favourite tropical fruits while enabling the creation of local jobs and preventing adverse effects on the environment.</p>

                <p>Today, 80% of Napa Valley winemakers use owls to control their rodent population, while less than 20% use rodenticide instead.</p>

<p>Farmers realized that they only needed to build nest boxes near their fields to attract owls and reap the benefits. For example, a farmer with 20 owl boxes can expect those owls to catch around 70,000 rodents per year — which represents a cost of 26 cents per rodent, against several dollars for traditional methods (e.g. trapping, rodenticide).</p>
<p>Replacing pesticides with barn owls for rodent control is part of a broader environmentally sustainable trend among Napa Valley farmers. Indeed, many also reduce their water consumption in the face of Californian droughts and plant perennial grass between rows to prevent the dangers of monoculture.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> For decades, Napa Valley's wineries relied on pesticides to prevent rodents from damaging their crops. However, this strategy, coupled with grapes-only monoculture and the usage of commercial fertilizer, generated a toxic taint in certain wines, demonstrating the need for more sustainable practices. In January 2021, California passed a law restricting rodenticides, but lobbying created a loophole for agricultural use.</p>
<p>Although still technically authorized, Napa's growers turned away from rodenticides because they understood that people and nature depend on each other to thrive. Also, they took this opportunity to make a few raptor friends along the way.</p>

                <p>American designer and entrepreneur <a href="https://joedoucet.com/index#/windturbinewall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Doucet</a> created a concept of a wind turbine that fits into a wall.</p>

<p>This "kinetic wall" comprises an array of rotary blades that spin individually, driving a mini generator that creates electricity. The electricity can then power the building to which the wall belongs or go back into the national grid, generating a new revenue stream for the owner.</p>
<p>However, this device is not only aesthetically pleasing. Indeed, one wall is enough to cover the energy needs of an average American home. Moreover, deploying such walls along roads and highways would be highly effective, as they would benefit from the natural wind and the one generated by the trucks and cars passing by.</p>
<p>Joe is currently working with several manufacturers to help him develop and commercialize this exciting product.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Wind energy plays a significant part in reducing the world's dependency on fossil fuels. However, wind turbines for homes have encountered very slow uptake due, in part, to their intrusive physicality. As a result, wind turbines flourish mainly offshore, where nobody can see them. This situation leads to wasting potential energy sources in cities prone to strong winds, such as Wellington (New Zealand), Perth (Australia), Chicago or Boston (USA).</p>
<p>Joe's kinetic wall can be a gamechanger in these urban areas by covering all their energy needs.</p>

<h2>🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide …</h2>
<p>💧 Alphabet's X lab recently <a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/sharing-project-h2e-with-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-sourced</a> the data, prototypes, software, and hardware documentation of its atmospheric water harvester, a device producing safe drinking water from air humidity. This move aims to improve the device's efficiency to give more than 1 billion people access to clean drinking water.</p>
<p>🐮 A team of scientists in Dummerstorf, Germany and Auckland, New Zealand, discovered that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00966-0#%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potty-training cows</a> could lead to a 56 percent reduction in ammonia emissions, which cause acid rain, NOx pollution and contamination in rivers.</p>
<p>🌱 The Swedish non-profit Milkywire created a curated list of carbon offsetting projects to help corporations support climate action as part of their CSR. The organization designed its "<a href="https://www.milkywire.com/climate-transformation-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">climate transformation portfolio</a>" to contain only credible and impactful projects.</p>
<p>🥗 Compass Group <a href="https://www.compass-group.co.uk/media/news/compass-group-uk-ireland-to-roll-out-eco-labels-across-business-industry-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rolled out an eco-label</a>, displaying products' ecological impact, across its workplace catering sites. This initiative occurred after a successful pilot project with researchers from Oxford's <a href="https://www.leap.ox.ac.uk/home#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Livestock, Environment and People</a> (LEAP) group that triggered a statistically significant shift towards ecologically greener foods among the participants, including a 10 percent reduction in meat consumption.</p>

                <p>Scientists and engineers at The University of Texas at Austin have created a hydrogel tablet to <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2021/10/05/this-hydrogel-tablet-can-purify-a-liter-of-river-water-in-an-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purify contaminated water</a> rapidly.</p>
<p>One tablet can clean a litre of water and make it drinkable in less than an hour. The hydrogel generates hydrogen peroxide to neutralize more than 99.999% of bacteria by attacking their essential cell components and disrupting their metabolism.</p>
<p>Moreover, the researchers say that scaling production would be straightforward. Indeed, materials are cheap, and the synthesis process is simple, even at scale. Also, they can control the tablets’ shape and size to adapt them to different use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Almost a third of the world does not have clean drinking water, and half of the population could experience extreme water scarcity by 2025. The existing purification processes rely on boiling water, which requires a lot of energy and time, and is not practical for the people who lack clean water the most.</p>
<p>Finding a solution to the water crisis could save millions of people. In this context, these hydrogel tablets can make a massive difference as they are easy to use, highly efficient and scalable to mass production.</p>

                <p>In London, the <a href="https://spring.co.uk/trade-inn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade-Inn pub</a> lets you pay for your food and beverages with electronic waste.</p>
<p>This pub accepts almost 14,000 electronic devices—including old iPhones—that they repair and resell afterwards or recycle if too damaged.</p>
<p>​<a href="https://spring.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring</a>, the company behind this project, is a new tech recirculation service that opens pods throughout England where people can drop their old tech in exchange for actual money.</p>
<p>So far, Spring has resold or recycled around 13,000 devices, saving almost 1,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions and diverting more than 2 tonnes of e-waste from landfills. Moreover, the company is currently working on opening a shop that sells refurbished items only.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Each year, the UK produces 1.6 million tonnes of electronic waste and is forecast to be Europe’s biggest producer by 2024. Today, much of this waste ends up in a landfill or incinerated, affecting the environment considerably.</p>
<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An average adult owns around 20 unused electronic devices. Putting them back in circulation would reduce the demand for new devices and the related environmental impact. Also, sorting and reselling our old tech can be highly beneficial for our bank account.</li>
<li>Although our old laptop might no longer be enough for us, many schools, libraries, or charities might give it a new purpose. The best way to donate a computer is to reach out to a third-party organization, such as <a href="https://spring.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digitunity</a> or the <a href="https://spring.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Computer Exchange</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) lets us reduce our reliance on hard drives and USB sticks to store our data, limiting the amount of e-waste we generate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the genius marketing stunt, the Trade-Inn pub raises awareness about electronic waste and provides an easy way to give our old devices a new life.</p>

                <p><a href="https://droneseed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DroneSeed</a> developed a drone-based technology to reforest lands after wildfires efficiently.</p>
<p>The drones pack everything new trees need to thrive: seeds, nutrients, and natural pest deterrent. Also, the company uses laser mapping technology to determine where the seeds have the highest chance of survival to optimize the process.</p>
<p>DroneSeed can reforest up to 50 acres per day with five drones and four employees. In contrast, traditional reforestation methods that plant nursery-grown trees by hand can only cover 2 acres per day and cost up to 50% more.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> The severity and frequency of recent wildfires threaten Nature’s capacity to reforest. Without intervention, most of these forests could disappear in the following decades, with dramatic repercussions on biodiversity, air quality and global warming.</p>
<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to prevent fire from spreading is never to leave a campfire or fire pit unattended. Also, we should make sure to extinguish it completely before leaving.</li>
<li>Under certain conditions, even a small campfire can turn into a significant fire. Therefore, it’s preferable to alert the authorities immediately whenever we spot an unattended fire — even a small one.</li>
