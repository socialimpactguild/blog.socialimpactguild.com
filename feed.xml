<p><strong>Laurinda, can you tell me about yourself and your organisation?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://kindkarmaco.com">Kind Karma</a> is a social enterprise. We employ at-risk and homeless youth in Toronto to handcraft fine jewelry. We pay them hourly wages and, on top of that, we return proceeds back to support their individual goals such as funding, education, housing, courses, among others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a really hard time for me and I thought about how challenging it must be for youth who are in vulnerable situations as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What motivated you to help at-risk and homeless youth in particular?</strong></p>
<p>I think it was my own journey. I had worked for a long time and I actually went to school, for music. So, I have always wanted to be creative. I could not finish my university degree because I had mental health challenges during my third year. So, when I came back, I struggled to find work.</p>
<p>As I was recovering from mental illness, it was very challenging; I think the options were not really there. Some days, you just have a bad day, it is not that you do not want to be helpful or happy, but you have a bad day. So, looking back, I thought about how challenging it must be for youth who are in vulnerable situations. They grew up in environments where survival had to be their main focus, and they might not have the wherewithal to get a degree or go to university. So, I wanted to create employment options that addressed that, and helped them find purpose and success in a different way.<br><br><strong>I know that you set up programs to both further improve their lifestyle and reduce turnover. Can you tell me about these programs and their outcomes?</strong></p>
<p>We have a couple of different things in order for proceeds to get back at work. There is a point system where youth are rewarded for creating healthy lifestyles. On top of that, we also have a mentorship program as we have a lot of great customers in professional industries, always happy to volunteer their time, and they are often asking how they can be involved. So, if we have a youth who has a question about a specific industry that they can answer to, we connect them. It helps our youth get answers and support in areas that they need to get to where they want to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have youth who are already looking for ways to give back and support their community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What changes have you noticed in their lives as a result of working with you? </strong></p>
<p>It has been incredible to see a variety of changes. A lot of them say that they have never been able to hold on a job as long as they have here. We have youth that say they would never want to leave because they just love it and it does not feel like work to them, which is so important. Also, when you are feeling unwell, your first instinct is to call in sick for everyone, but it has been amazing to see that our youth actually come to work and they leave saying, "I am glad I came in today because I actually feel better having been here!". That is such a great thing to hear!</p>
<p>Also, it has been amazing to see that our youth want to pay it forward already. We have youth who are already looking for ways to give back and support their community and it is just so heartwarming to see because, coming from a population that does not have that much, and to have them already want to give back whatever they can, it is really inspiring. It motivates me to do what I do even more.</p>
<p><strong>I really love your organisation because it provides people with opportunities to learn, grow and gain independence. To me, Kind Karma is what social entrepreneurship is all about: a complete symbiosis between social impact and business.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning to manage time, prioritise, find balance and have downtime was challenging [...] early on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Now, I would like to talk more about your journey as a social entrepreneur. So, tell me, what have been the biggest challenges that you have had at the different stages of your journey?</strong></p>
<p>I think as a social entrepreneur, it is challenging because there is no roadmap to entrepreneurship. You can have resources along the way but it is a very unique journey for everybody. Everyone has their own challenges because everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>When I was starting out, my biggest challenge was finding balance in my life. I am very much an overachiever, I always needed to get things done immediately. I drove myself where I was just piling things on. Ultimately, I would not get anything done because it was just too much for me to accomplish in one day. I would get overwhelmed and beat myself up about it. Learning to manage time, prioritise, find balance and have downtime was challenging. There were times where I felt bad if I was not working and doing something for the business. It was easy for me to burn out and become not as good as I could be because my mental health was not optimal. So, it was definitely a challenge early on.</p>
<p>And now, 2020 has been kind of a crazy year. Learning how to navigate all these changes in the way that people do business and interact with each other has been a challenge. Also, get our mission and our journey out there without being able to do in-person events or meet people has been a very different challenge.</p>
<p><strong>It can be difficult to balance work and life in general. When you are an entrepreneur, it is even more difficult because it is your own business so you are even more involved. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I agree with you, it is crucial to get some time for ourselves and make sure that we are taking care of our mental and physical health, because if we are not doing great ourselves, we will not be able to do good for other people or make our business work. Right now, it has probably gotten more complicated because we are spending a lot of time at home.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2020 [...] it was challenging because, for a lot of youth who do not have structure or do not even have optimal or healthy domestic environments, it is hard for them to stay focused and to even be motivated to do things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I wanted to ask you, how has the pandemic impacted your operations? I remember you were using a co-working space at a university, has that changed?</strong><br><br>That was one of our challenges too in 2020. We used to work at a small co-working space and then it shut down. So, I was hardened for a while. I mailed supplies to youth to work at home but it was challenging because, for a lot of youth who do not have structure or do not even have optimal or healthy domestic environments, it is hard for them to stay focused and to even be motivated to do things.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of last year, we got our own space and we are excited to say that we are actually going to be moving again soon because we have already outgrown our space. It is a great problem to have and we are excited about that. It has always been my dream to have a space where our youth can come in, be safe, have snacks, play games, things like that. We are able to save space for them to enjoy not only work, but just life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is one big community, we are all in one world, we are all working together to make it a better place, and we should all support each other regardless of what we are doing and just be kind to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So, what have been your main takeaways during your journey while tackling these challenges?</strong></p>
<p>I am just so happy to have found this social enterprise model. I remember when I first started, it was not something that we even talked about. You would either have a nonprofit, which did good, or you would have a business, which made money, and there was no merging of the two.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see such a different mentality among social entrepreneurs. Some of my best friends are people who you would traditionally consider competitors, as they own jewelry companies as well, but we all just know that everybody is doing their own good in the world and it does not matter if they are selling a similar product. They are working and doing something that is also creating good change in the world. So, why can't we support each other? I love that mentality: it is one big community, we are all in one world, we are all working together to make it a better place, and we should all support each other regardless of what we are doing and just be kind to each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing that I have created a little bit of a difference in someone's life is the biggest achievement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What would you say are your biggest achievements as a social entrepreneur?</strong><br> <br>Just hearing our youth saying that they came in and they felt better or that they have been able to stay here and work longer than they have in the past, that is an achievement. It means that I have created a safe and welcoming space.</p>
<p>Those things mean more to me than anything physical or any kind of accolades. Knowing that I have created a little bit of a difference in someone's life is the biggest achievement.</p>
<p><strong>What is your vision for the years to come and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong><br><br>I have always wanted to help youth in major cities across the country. That is on the vision board. I always feel that, in big cities, at-risk and homeless youth always tend to fall through the cracks because they are one in millions of people and there is only so many resources that can go around. So, I would love to have a Kind Karma office in major cities from coast to coast and hopefully make an impact there.</p>
<p>Also, sometime in the future, maybe we will expand our offerings and do different kinds of things. I have always loved candles, so maybe something like that. That is a brainstorming project now, but I would love to expand our footprint across the country to help more youth.</p>
<p><strong>What other challenges are you expecting in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I think our next challenge might be to scale effectively. How do we make sure that, as we get bigger, everybody still has that small business feel? Or, how do we make sure that everybody still has that personal connection? Hopefully, we get bigger and get to scale, but I think every stage has its own unique challenges and I love that about it.</p>
<p><strong>How can people support your organisation today?</strong></p>
<p>They can visit our website <a href="https://kindkarma.ca/">kindkarmaco.com</a> to learn more and, obviously, we love purchases, but even just a social media follow or share, anything like that, is always so appreciated. Our Instagram handle is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kindkarmaco/">@kindkarmaco</a>. Our Facebook is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kindkarmaco">facebook.com/kindkarmaco</a>. It does not always have to be monetary support. We also appreciate everybody sharing our story and our mission.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks so much for sharing your story! </strong><strong>I love seeing you and talking about Kind Karma. Is there anything else that you would like to share with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong><br><br>I just want to say thank you to everyone who has supported us and who will take the time after this to look us up and read more about what we do. I cannot tell you, for us as a small business, how much that means, especially in a time where small businesses need it more than ever. So, thank you, and we really appreciate it!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can you tell me about yourself and the Toronto Local Currency?</strong></p>
<p>Hi Nadia, thank you for having me. I am an international development professional and I have dedicated my career to eliminating poverty abroad. My work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Gender_Equality_Canada">Women and Gender Equality Canada</a>, helping with the COVID-19 response, made me wonder about the economic crisis that had accompanied the pandemic at home. So, I decided that I should use some of my expertise in the international development realm to try and help address this crisis right here at home. <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">That is where the idea for Toronto Local Currency came up. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">When looking at how people deal with crises, I saw that local currency is a tool that is often used. It is not a new idea at all. Local currencies have been used since the Mesopotamian times, and were actually quite popular during the Great Depression. To this day, around 100 local currencies are operational around the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>What effects are you expecting from this local currency?</strong></p>
<p>The inspiration behind it is to get money to the people who need it most, and make sure that it actually builds a community. In international development, we would call this a conditional cash transfer. In the case of Toronto Local Currency, the condition is that they spend it locally. So, the money stays in Toronto rather than making Jeff Bezos a richer man.</p>
<p>Also, they must spend it on things that are actually going to improve their lives. So, there are some limitations (e.g. no lottery tickets, alcohol) to maximise impact, increase donor confidence in this vehicle and empower people. It is really about giving people the ability to make decisions for what they need the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We worked with a local artist to come up with symbolism that captures the history and spirit of Toronto and Canada more broadly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Is it a virtual currency or do you print your own money?</strong></p>
<p>Toronto Local Currency is actually a physical note. We have been discussing with some partners having some sort of virtual platform, but it was important for us to have this be a physical note to reduce the barriers to adoption. Some people are not tech savvy, we did not want that to be a barrier to them participating.</p>
<p>Also, we wanted to make sure it is secure and stable. A lot of online platforms can be hacked. By having a physical bill, you will eliminate some of that risk.</p>
<p>Finally, we worked with a local artist to come up with symbolism that captures the history and spirit of Toronto and Canada more broadly. It is a beautiful-looking note that I think people will not only feel pride in using but also want to buy, which is part of our revenue generating and sustainability model.<br><br><strong>You mentioned that many local currencies exist worldwide. Actually, in my hometown in Lyon, France, we also have one (<a href="http://www.lagonette.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"la Gonette"</a>). It supports the local economy and raises awareness on how currencies work. Did you get any insights from these other local currencies worldwide? </strong><br><br>Yes, the inspiration was from currencies worldwide and historical usage. There was a local currency in Toronto, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_dollar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toronto dollar</a>, that failed because of the way it was structured. Also, there was a virtual currency that was highly speculative and tied into the Bunz trading platform that also similarly failed. I examined those economic models closely to determine where mistakes were made. Toronto Local Currency is structured differently to ensure that it would have more stability and would not be speculative, so that consumers and retailers will feel confident and comfortable in using it.<br><br><strong>What exactly happened with these other currencies in Canada?</strong></p>
<p>The Toronto Dollar took a commission from retailers who accepted it, and donated this commission to charity. However, losing a percentage of your revenue on each transaction adds up for a small business owner. While it is great that money went to charity, it did not actually inspire business owners to adopt the currency.</p>
<p>We do not take any commission from our retailers and service providers who accept it. It is a way to inject liquidity into the Toronto market, help inspire more spending locally and benefit local businesses the most.</p>
<p>The virtual currency became far too speculative. Eventually, it was just too far removed from actual value to be real. So, the value proposition and economic model collapsed because there was no Canadian money to back the virtual one.</p>
<p>Toronto Local Currency is different in that every TLC is backed by a Canadian dollar. People can be confident that every TLC actually does stand for a Canadian dollar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLC is a way of facilitating that cash transfer to people in need, but also adding a coolness factor for people who do not need help right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I saw that you are giving free TLC to people with lower income. How does this work and how do you fund it?</strong></p>
<p>TLC is funded by two main buckets of money. One is through donors and the other through consumers. Certainly, some people in Toronto would want to purchase TLC because it looks great, it is a symbol of local investment and local pride, and a cool souvenir.</p>
<p>People can buy it at an exchange rate of two to one (e.g. 20 Canadian dollars for 10 TLC). On the other hand, donors and sponsors would be donating in a regular way. Overall, TLC is a way of facilitating that cash transfer to people in need, but also adding a coolness factor for people who do not need help right now.<br><br><strong>I hope Torontonians will join you and embrace this currency!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that it is time for young women and visible minorities to have authority, influence and energy, and share our creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Let's talk about your entrepreneurial journey. What are the biggest challenges that you have had so far?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly, the challenges that most young women of color face: our credentials and abilities are questioned and examined much more harshly than our white male or even white female colleagues. I remember the first time I was starting a business, seven years ago. I went to the bank to get a business account and the man across the desk kept questioning me like he could not believe that a young woman of color had started a business. I don't think that would have happened to someone who had looked different than myself in that position. I think that it is time for young women and visible minorities to have authority, influence and energy, and share our creativity.<br><br><strong>How to tackle these challenges?</strong></p>
<p>You cannot let the backwards thinking of a couple of people keep you from what you are meant to do. You look for allies, partners, strategic partnerships that are going to empower you. Not everyone is going to have confidence in you. Some people are going to question you, be prepared for that, but do not let it stand in your way because you might just have the idea for the next big thing that could do a lot of good and change a lot of people's lives for the better.<br><br><strong>Today, do you feel you have any challenges that you need help to overcome?</strong><br><br>We have had to do some strategic, large pivots. The project was supposed to have a much more exciting roll-out than is possible right now with the harsh lock-down in Ontario. As it is a physical currency, it requires people to be able to actually go into shops, restaurants and grooming services. Also, some of our partnerships, like with various Christmas markets, had to be cancelled. So, right now we have had to pivot to just expanding the network rather than getting the currency operational immediately.</p>
<p><strong>I agree that we have to adapt and try to find other ways to make things happen.<br></strong><strong>Now, let's talk about the organisation itself. What is the status of your organisation?</strong></p>
<p>Charitable status in Canada is actually fairly difficult to get and has quite a few restraints on what you are able to do, as well as burdensome administrative requirements. To increase our flexibility and allow this project to get off the ground early enough, we made the conscious decision to leave it as a social entrepreneurship vehicle rather than go for official charitable status.<br><br><strong>You mentioned donations earlier. Would you say you rely more on donations or people buying TLC?</strong><br><br>At this point, bearing in mind the market conditions, we rely more on donations. As the economy opens up again, I expect that will change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are empowering people to make their own best decisions and to do it in a way that helps benefit the local economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Overall, what would you say are your biggest achievements for this project?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that the biggest achievement is mostly the impact that we have to empower people and give them dignity. If you provide someone with groceries that are not culturally relevant, or give a single mom a bag of groceries when what she really needs are diapers, you have helped them but you have not solved their problems.</p>
<p>Toronto Local Currency empowers people to solve the problems that are most pressing for them. We are empowering people to make their own best decisions and do it in a way that helps benefit the local economy. You have a two-fold benefit from one economic tool and I think that is really cool.<br><br><strong>What is your vision for the years to come and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong></p>
<p>We want to scale. Hopefully, this pandemic and the recession will end and we will be unnecessary. That is the thing about development projects: your greatest hope is always to put yourself out of business.</p>
<p>I hope that for the next few years, TLC can become a tool that is widely used in Toronto, and helps people think more about their decisions when they are buying. I hope that this is going to be a project which inspires people to buy locally and consciously.</p>

                    <p>A few days ago, I had the pleasure to meet Pratiksha Pandey, a social entrepreneur in Nepal that encourages young girls to pursue an education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics). I was excited when I came across her organisation, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/smartcheli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Cheli</a>, because I am extremely passionate about science and social entrepreneurship. So, Smart Cheli's purpose resonated with me. You can discover this incredible organisation through this short interview!</p>

<p><strong>Could you present yourself and your organisation?</strong><br>Thank you Nadia for having me. Hi, I am Pratiksha Pandey I am from Nepal and I have been working in this field for five years. Also, I am currently working as a mentor for the <a href="https://www.nyas.org/programs/global-stem-alliance/1000-girls-1000-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"1000 Girls, 1000 Futures" program</a> for the New York Academy of Science and I am leading the organisation Smart Cheli (<em>Smart Daughter</em>) here in Nepal. Smart Cheli is an organisation that provides STEAM education to young girls. We provide STEAM workshops and mentorship. In the STEAM workshops, we involve the young girls in project-based learning in our space. During the mentorship program, we connect them with mentors based on their interests. We also provide STEAM workshops in schools as extracurricular activities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no gender-based subject. It's all up to you. It's all up to your interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why did you start this organisation? What was the motivation behind it?</strong><br>When I was in college, I was doing a Bachelor in Electronics and Communications Engineering - and we were three girls. Before that, a lot of people were saying that engineering is not for girls - and that it is hard for them. But, in my classroom, we were three girls, doing the same things than boys, and getting the same marks, so it didn't make sense! That made me feel like that there is no gender-based subject. It's all up to you. It's all up to your interest. These are stereotypes that make us feel that we are less capable. So, many girls are falling behind and not joining these fields because of these stereotypes. I think that, to avoid this, we need to go back to the schools, increase awareness among young girls and make them feel they are not less capable.<br><br><strong>What have been your most exciting achievements or experiences during your social entrepreneurship journey?</strong> <br>Before Smart Cheli, I was engaged with <a href="https://www.wistemnepal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women In STEM</a> in Nepal. When I was working with that organisation, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.cledepeau-beaute.com/int/powerofradiance-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power of Radiance Award 2020</a> for the work in the field of education. That is not such a big achievement because there are so many things yet to achieve but this award recognised our work around the globe. Yes, that was the happiest moment in my life!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are human beings, we want to face people when we talk to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact your organisation?</strong><br>Yes, COVID has had an impact because some of the schools are opening, but many are still closed. So, we are not going back to the schools and now, we are just doing virtual sessions for girls. We are not able to bring them in our space and watch their performance by ourselves. It makes everything more monotonous. We are human beings, we want to face people when we talk to them. The pandemic make things a little bit complicated, but it will pass and things will go back to the way they were before.<br><br><strong>Prior to COVID-19, what other challenges have you faced as a social entrepreneur? </strong><br>Before the pandemic, we were planning to reach out to programs in other districts in Nepal and reach out to more girls that do not have access to STEAM education. These plans are postponed for now, but we will resume them after the situation becomes normal again.<br><br><strong>What is your vision for the years to come? Also, do you generate revenues to sustain your purpose or do you rely solely on donations and government grants?</strong><br>Currently, we are sustained by grants and we are also planning to be self-sustained. It is not possible to be entirely self-sustained but we are planning to generate some revenues, from our workshops for instance, that will help us in some way. We are also looking to collaborate with local government to reach more people, and seeking other grants or applying for not-for-profit organisation programs. We are trying to make everything more effective and sustainable.<br><br><strong>How would you define a social enterprise?</strong><br>Yes, there are lots of definitions for it. And also, they can be different in different countries. At first, I was thinking that a social enterprise is an enterprise that serves society in some way and takes money from it, which will help grow the organisation. However, in Nepal, that definition is slightly wrong because here a social enterprise is just a company which uses grants and cannot make profit. It's not a profit-making company but we can use revenues to organise and manage our office.</p>

                    <p>Nowadays, several definitions of social entrepreneurship coexist. 
I think this ambiguity might sometimes dilute social entrepreneurs’ image, reduce their credibility vis-a-vis other entrepreneurs, weaken the relevance of the insights they receive and, ultimately, harm their purpose. Therefore, having a shared understanding of what social entrepreneurship means seems essential.</p>

<h2 id="a-social-entrepreneurship-definition">A Social Entrepreneurship Definition</h2>
<p>From my point of view, a social entrepreneur is an entrepreneur whose decisions are <strong>primarily</strong> driven towards effecting lasting, large-scale social benefits. This definition covers a specific section of the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-social-enterprise-hybrid-spectrum-as-constructed-by-Kim-Alter-2007-p14_fig1_304624327">social-business hybrid spectrum</a>, including non-profit organizations that leverage <strong>business tools</strong> to achieve sustainability and pursue their social mission at scale. However, it excludes corporations practicing social responsibility as social impact is not their primary focus.</p>

<h2 id="some-insights-regarding-social-entrepreneurs">Some Insights Regarding Social Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>After meeting with social entrepreneurs from various industries and backgrounds, I noticed that their similarities outweight their differences by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>First, they have all developed a social fibre through experiences that have changed their understanding of the world. This evolution led them to solve problems they witnessed or suffered themselves, usually by leveraging their passions or previous knowledge.</p>
<p>The social entrepreneurs I have met are also extremely action-oriented and lean towards a trial-and-error approach to problem-solving, as they are uncomfortable with the status quo and feel the urgency to break it.</p>
<p>However, they are down-to-earth and want to effect social impact while generating benefits for themselves as well. These benefits can sometimes take a cathartic form: by preventing others from suffering, they relieve their own pain.</p>
<p>My discussions also underlined that social entrepreneurs are resilient and believe they have (or can find) the skills to tackle the obstacles standing in their path. Nervertheless, this observation might be an instance of survivorship bias. Indeed, less optimistic people might have given up during the early stages of their journey and I would not have had the chance to meet them. Otherwise, being overly optimistic can sometimes be the only path to succeed - as Mark Twain put it, <em>“they did not know it was impossible, so they did it”</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite their optimism and urge to act, social entrepreneurs I have met are not risk-takers. They started their venture with small investments, and a home-made <em>do-it-yourself</em> approach. My chats revealed that this risk aversion can sometimes generate challenges when comes the time to advance to a higher-stake stage.</p>
<p>Finally, I find that social entrepreneurs I know are particularly open to new ideas and insights. Nonetheless, this inference may be biased as they are all people willing to chat!</p>

                    <p>Hi, my name is Nadia.</p>
<p>I was borned in Central America, worked towards going to France to have better opportunities in life and did it at 17 years-old by myself. Since then, I have travelled the world to live, study varied subjects and work. </p>

<p>Inspired by the life of my incredible grand-father, who dedicated his entire life to helping others, I decided to focus my work towards effecting positive social outcomes. I want to create as many projects as possible to help people and their communities. Recently, I completed an MBA to increase my chances of achieving this goal. </p>
<p>Now, one of my endeavours is to create a support system for social entrepreneurs. Indeed, I had the chance to meet with some of them during my journey and they were all extremely passionate about generating lasting, large-scale social benefits. So, I felt an immediate strong connection with them. </p>
<p>Since they all shared challenges and drivers, I decided I would do something to help them, ignite the same spark amongst other people and leverage our common knowledge to support each other and our communities.</p>
<p>The Social Impact Guild aims to help social entrepreneurs gain visibility and leverage their cumulative experience to face their day-to-day challenges. It would also provide a safe space where social entrepreneurs can share their feelings and stories. If you are a social entrepreneur or someone who wants to enable social impact, you can express your interest by completing this short survey (2-3 mins): <a href="https://socialimpactguild.com/survey">https://socialimpactguild.com/survey</a>  </p>
<p>Thank you for reading this post. I am looking forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
