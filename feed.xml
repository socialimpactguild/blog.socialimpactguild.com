<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">📈 Social Impact Trends</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Commission announced new </span><a href="https://earth.org/eu-approves-law-to-reduce-emissions-55-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally binding policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to meet the climate change goals of reducing 55% of emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G20 formally considers putting a </span><a href="https://earth.org/g20-carbon-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price tag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on total carbon pollution as an incentive to drive investment into renewable and cleaner energy. The overarching goal is to consolidate international coordination on reducing global carbon emissions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The European Union aims to eliminate all petrol and diesel-powered vehicles – responsible for 12% of total EU CO2 emissions – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by 2035</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Working with Lawless Studio, the French and British artists created these paintings to celebrate Lindeman’s winery’s carbon neutral certification through the Carbon Trust.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.graphenstone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphenstone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> paint, the secret ingredient behind the murals, is a product combining lime and graphene technology. This company leverages these two components to create a carcinogen-free paint that filters the ambient air. Due to a natural process, the lime absorbs CO2 and cleans the air we breathe when it’s carbonating.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to the European Environment Agency data, the mural in London will absorb about 1.3kg of carbon dioxide in its lifetime -- the same amount a mature tree would absorb in three weeks. On the other hand, the Bristol one will absorb a whopping 2.6kg of CO2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art has been instrumental in helping the world cope with the pandemic, and it looks like it could also play its part in decarbonizing our air 💪</span></p>

<p data-key="2676"><span data-key="2677"><span spellcheck="true" data-slate-content="true">This waste will now become the cornerstone of the Ivory Coast’s ecological transition to renewable energy. According to the Ivorian company Société des Energies Nouvelles (Soden), this biomass plant will produce between 46 and 70MW of electricity per year, providing electricity to 1.7 million people (around 7% of the country's entire population).</span></span></p>
<p data-key="2678"><span data-key="2679"><span spellcheck="true" data-slate-content="true">Ivory Coast currently gets most of its power from fossil fuels – natural gas generating 70% of its energy.

Specifically, her team <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90655823/mussels-can-be-a-natural-filter-to-remove-microplastic-from-the-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uses mussels</a> to filter water and extract tiny pieces of plastic – smaller than 5 millimetres across – generated from plastic pollution disintegration.</p>
<p>As it feeds, an adult mussel can filter up to 55 litres of water a day. During their experiments, Pennie’s team placed 300 mussels in a tank and found that they filtered out more than 250,000 microplastics per hour! The mussels eventually excrete the microplastics, which naturally sink into the water and become readily disposable. All this happens without causing any harm to the mussels.</p>
<p>In the future, Pennie also hopes to use the plastic-filled excrements as a biofuel since they are rich in carbon.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Collecting microplastic is difficult. Projects like the <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/turning-face-masks-into-trees-and-cleaning-up-the-ocean#cleanup-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ocean Cleanup</a> can gather large pieces of plastic, but no organization has yet managed to extract smaller particles at scale. By leveraging nature’s potential, this project could uncover a way to tackle microplastic pollution naturally 😎</p>

<h2>🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</h2>
<p>🏊‍ The residents of New York City might soon be able to swim in the famously polluted Hudson River. To achieve this feat, the non-profit organization <a href="https://pluspool.org/pool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">+ POOL</a> designed a plus-shaped, water-filtering, floating swimming pool. Once deployed, this 9,000 square foot pool will filter 600,000 gallons per day -- cleaning the river bit by bit while letting New Yorkers enjoy a new recreational space.</p>
<p>🚲 In Finland, you can now go to your library to borrow books and <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/finnish-library-loans-out-e-cargo-bikes-for-free-5191645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e-cargo bikes</a>! The goal is to remove barriers to adoption by lending box bikes – ideal for carrying children, groceries etc. – for free. This initiative proves once again that libraries are vital to our communities 🤩</p>
<p>💧 A team of Korean researchers developed a nanofiber membrane that can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-filter-is-really-good-at-turning-seawater-into-fre-1847220376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn salt water into fresh water</a> in minutes by rejecting 99.99% of salt while staying fully dry. This groundbreaking innovation could help the 900 million people worldwide who lack a clean source of drinking water.</p>
<p>👕 Lululemon, the athletic apparel retailer, is experimenting with the first-ever fabric made <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90655566/lululemon-is-experimenting-with-the-first-fabric-made-from-recycled-carbon-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from ethanol produced by pollution-eating bacteria</a>. The company partnered with LanzaTech, a biotech startup that turns pollution into ethanol and uses it as feedstock to produce polyester. The resulting fabric is completely identical to regular polyester and could pave the way to a future without fossil-carbon-based clothes.</p>
<p>👟 Honda, the Japanese car company, designed an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/6/honda-navigation-system-in-shoe-gps-visually-impaired-people-wearable-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-shoe navigation system</a> for people with vision loss. The system includes a three-dimensional vibration device and a motion sensor attached inside the shoe. The associated app can guide the person by making their foot vibrate in the required direction. This mechanism is insensitive to ambient noises and leaves users free to use their hands.</p>
<p>🎵 When the musician Yoko Sen had to spend time in a hospital, she noticed that the surrounding sound affected her ability to recuperate. So as soon as she recovered, she created <a href="http://www.sensound.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SenSound</a> to humanize hospital sounds. Almost 80% of sounds in the ER come from patient monitoring, and making them more soothing can go a long way towards improving patients’ journey and recovery.</p>

<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/nemosgarden-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/nemosgarden-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/nemosgarden-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/nemosgarden-2-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1080" height="608"></figure>
<p>While enjoying vacation by the Italian sea, Sergio Gamberini wondered whether he could combine his passions for scuba diving and gardening to grow basil underwater. Indeed, akin to most herbs, this essential ingredient for pesto prefers protected, sunny locations with well-drained soils and a constant, stable temperature - everything the bottom of the sea can provide!</p>
<p>From this question, Sergio created <a href="http://www.nemosgarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo’s Garden</a>. This project consists of transparent, air-filled biospheres 20 feet below the sea surface to create an alternative agriculture system.</p>
<p>Underwater agriculture presents many advantages over standard agriculture. First, the biospheres are self-sustainable in terms of water. Indeed, the seawater at the biospheres' bottom evaporates and condensates on the internal surfaces, creating fresh water for the plants. Also, since the biospheres contain a parasite-free closed ecosystem, no pesticide is necessary. Finally, data have shown Sergio’s team that higher pressure conditions positively affect plant growth.</p>
<p>Otherwise, current experiments demonstrated that the amount of sunlight illuminating the biosphere is sufficient to allow the plants to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Today, <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70% of global fresh water</a> is used for agriculture, and the growing population will further increase the pressure on water resources. In this context, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change.</p>
<p>For now, Nemo’s Garden is an experiment, and underwater agriculture's limits are yet to be defined. However, this project is extremely interesting for our planet's future as it uses renewable energy from the sun and generates fresh water from sea water desalination.</p>
<h2 id="laser">🐞 The Team That Wants to Replace Pesticides With Laser Beams</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/pea.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1081"></figure>
<p>A team of researchers in Lyon, France, leveraged their knowledge in artificial intelligence to develop a technology that identifies and removes pest from plants. For their proof of concept, they chose a particularly tough opponent.</p>
<p>The pea aphid is a sap-sucking insect that feeds on legumes such as pea, clover, alfalfa, and broad bean. This pest is extremely hard to find since it’s only a few millimetres long, enjoys hiding below the leaves and is green!</p>
<p>​<a href="https://anr-greenshield.insa-lyon.eu/en/node/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenshield Technology</a>’s robot can drive through the plants without crushing them and take pictures with its embedded camera. It then uses an innovative algorithm to identify pea aphids in the pictures. Once found, it eliminates them with a patented robotized laser beam.</p>
<p>The team managed to calibrate the laser beam to remove the insect without damaging the plant or affect the overall biodiversity in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Usually, farmers get rid of pests such as pea aphids with pesticides. However, only 0.3% of sprayed pesticides come in contact with the target pest. Moreover, they also affect pollinating insects and humans.</p>
<p>The Greenshield project could be a major breakthrough for sustainable agriculture and biodiversity protection 🐝</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MosquitiaMed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MosquitiaMed</a> is a volunteer-based organization using telemedicine to improve access to health for the Miskitos community in Honduras. This group's first goal is to educate the population about basic healthcare to promote and share community-based solutions to simple health problems. As a result, they solve low-complexity health issues, avoid unnecessary referrals, and reduce complications from lack of treatment.</p>
<p>For more serious health issues, the organization provides telemedicine through a mobile application to offer access to specialists in Tegucigalpa, Honduras’ capital city. If required, it can also gather resources to move the patient to Tegucigalpa and treat them for free.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Although Gracias a Dios - the department where the Miskitos community lives - is the second largest in Honduras, it can only be reached by air or water. Also, this department is one of the poorest and has one of the worst health indicators in the country. Moreover, its largest city, Puerto Lempira, has only one hospital that cannot address complex needs because it lacks supply and specialists.</p>

By doing so, these good boys help us preserve wildlife. We don’t deserve dogs 😍</p>
<p>🧭 The Spanish company <a href="https://www.navilens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NaviLens</a> designed a technology similar to QR codes that helps visually-impaired people navigate unfamiliar environments. However, unlike QR codes, which need precise scanning, NaviLens’ technology only requires pointing the smartphone vaguely towards the sign to work. These codes are already present in public transport systems throughout Spain and New York. Starting from January, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57679943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kellogg’s products</a> will also feature them to help visually-impaired people shop.</p>
<p>📚 In Argentina, the Mempo Giardinelli Foundation created a program called <a href="http://www.fundamgiardinelli.org/abuelascuentacuentos/abuelas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abuelas Cuentacuentos</a> (“Grandmothers Storytelling”). The volunteer senior citizens of this program are visiting children in schools or hospitals to read books aloud. The goal is to give them access to books and spark their interest in reading for pleasure ✨</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">📈 Social Impact Trends</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, 170 countries have pledged to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47592111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plastic use by 2030 significantly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2015 to 2019, sustainability-marketed products contributed nearly </span><a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/faculty-research/latest-research-nyu-stern-center-sustainable-business-and-iri-shows-sustainability-surviving-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55% of market growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the consumer packaged goods market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Sustainable alternatives may represent a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/12/2208288/0/en/Green-Packaging-Market-to-Hit-USD-385-34-Billion-by-2028-Rising-Food-Beverage-Sector-to-Stimulate-Growth-Fortune-Business-Insights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$385 billion market by 2028</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, for now, only a few solutions are both environmentally sustainable and cost-effective.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="carrots"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🥕 The Startup That Re-Brands Misshapen Produce</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/carrot.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/carrot-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/carrot-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/carrot-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1120" height="633"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before reaching our grocery stores, fruits and vegetables go through a real beauty pageant. What if we could embrace them as they are, regardless of their appearance?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Balle, a former accountant in Auckland, is launching </span><a href="https://supie.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online supermarket that focuses on sustainability and local producers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up on a vegetable farm, she witnessed first-hand perfectly healthy produce being wasted because of its aspect. So, she spent 18 months travelling the country to talk to producers and realized their main issue was getting access to supermarkets that would want to sell their produce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah’s online store aims to act as the only intermediate between growers and consumers while leaving cosmetic considerations out of the equation. Her goal is to educate consumers and create a store where "ugly" fruit and vegetables are the norm.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world wastes about 1.3 billion tonnes of food every year, and imperfect produce accounts for around 40% of this total. The food wasted in New Zealand alone could feed a city like Dunedin for </span><a href="https://lovefoodhatewaste.co.nz/food-waste/what-we-waste/#:~:text=How%20much%20food%20do%20we,about%20%241.17%20billion%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost 3 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even though some of this food is being fed to animals or composted and used to fertilize the soil, preventing this waste could go a long way towards food security and economic growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiatives like Supie can provide consumers with more sustainable options at a similar price to existing players. Let’s focus on the health characteristics of what we eat rather than what it looks like 🙈</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: stuff.co.nz)</span></p>
<h2 id="coral"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐠 The Doctor Who Wants to Plant 1 Million Corals</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/coral.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/coral-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/coral-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/coral-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1706" height="960"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they may look like plants, corals are actually animals. However, they contain plants and secrete minerals, so the confusion is understandable 😅</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. David Vaughan, Ph.D. in Marine Sciences, wants to plant </span><a href="http://plantamillioncorals.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 million corals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thanks to an innovative technique he discovered by accident!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While moving coral samples in an aquarium, he accidentally broke one into small pieces that fell at the bottom of the aquarium. He thought these corals were lost and forgot about them. A few weeks later, he came back to the aquarium and noticed that they had not only survived but multiplied and grown. By pursuing his research, he discovered that small pieces of coral placed close to each other would grow together and fuse back as one piece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this micro-fragmentation process, growth and healing happen up to 40 times faster than they occur naturally on the reef. It means that it could take only a couple of years to restore 100-year-old corals! David envisions using this innovative technique to reproduce resistant coral strains and recover the lost reefs.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With 25-40% already lost, the worldwide coral population is in incredible danger. They provide habitats for numerous fish (including Nemo and Dory!), and fisheries depend on them for up to 40% of their catch. Coral reefs are also the rainforests of the sea: they absorb heaps of carbon dioxide and produce a large amount of the oxygen we breathe. Finally, they protect the shorelines from waves and storms and help mitigate climate change effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time to find Nemo has passed. Now, let’s save his habitat 🐠</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/gambia-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/gambia-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/gambia-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/gambia-2-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple NGOs are currently working on a mammoth project: Africa’s </span><a href="https://www.greatgreenwall.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great Green Wall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This African-led movement has the ambition to grow an 8,000km natural wonder of the world across the entire width of Africa. The goal is to create a barrier against climate change running across the Sahel region – from Senegal to Djibouti. The Sahel forms a transitional zone between the Sahara desert and the rainforest and is one of the poorest places on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once complete, the Great Green Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet, 3 times bigger than Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Since its beginning in 2007, this initiative brought food security, jobs and stability to locals. More than just growing trees and plants, the Great Green Wall is thus transforming millions of lives in the Sahel region. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, the region became virtually uncultivable due to climate change and deforestation. The lack of rainwater allows saltwater from the sea to move upstream and destroy crops. Moreover, without trees, the soil has lost all its nutrients, and crops don’t grow. This situation led to biodiversity loss, poverty, mass emigration, violence and food insecurity. The Great Green Wall isn’t just for the Sahel, though. It could contribute to solving the world’s pressing threats – notably climate change, drought, famine, conflict and migration. </span></p>

The goal is to develop entrepreneurial competencies to instil self-reliance among traditional weavers amidst the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🧸 After LEGO, Mattel has also jumped on the sustainability train.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">📈 Social Impact Trends</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌱 </span><a href="https://www.environmentalleader.com/2021/06/adidas-ceo-70-of-consumers-prefer-to-buy-sustainable-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>70% of consumers</strong></a><strong> consider sustainability a significant buying argument.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, lip service is not enough. Customers demand concrete efforts towards sustainable products and services that have to be baked into companies’ business strategies. Moving forward, businesses will have to succeed in sustainability at the risk of becoming obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎨 </span><strong>The creative economy is one of the most rapidly expanding sectors worldwide.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women, youth and BIPOC are driving this economy, addressing pressing issues from climate change to diversity, equity and inclusion. As such, this sector is a “</span><a href="https://unctad.org/news/how-creative-economy-can-help-power-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">powerful force for good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and could become a key target for </span><a href="https://nextbillion.net/impact-investors-global-creative-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impact investors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the years to come.</span></p>
<h2 id="barbers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🪒 The Barbers Who Are Addressing Mental Health Issues</span></h2>
<p>A relationship between a barber and their clients can be special, almost like a family bond. If you watched the amazing TV show “New Amsterdam,” you might already be familiar with the initiative we’ll present now 😊</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lorenzo Lewis wanted to leverage this relationship and founded the </span><a href="https://www.theconfessproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confess Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As part of this project, he opened the first mental health barbershop in the US. The idea is to train barbers to be mental health advocates and pick up on signs of when their clients are going through rough patches. </span></p>
<p>Engaging in a conversation and providing support can go a long way towards building a positive culture for young men of colour, boys and their families, and changing assumptions about mental health.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/confess_project.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/confess_project-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/confess_project-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/confess_project-md.jpg 768w"  alt="@theconfessproject | Facebook" width="2050" height="780"></figure>
<p>90% of the clients involved in this project indicated they would rather receive therapy through their barbershop than go into a therapy clinic. To be fair, if you get mental health support from trained people and a rad haircut on top of it, it’s a pretty sweet combo 😎</p>
<p>Tens of millions of people struggle with mental health in the US, so this movement has naturally reached virtually every part of the country. Their goal is to train 1,000 barbers by the end of the year. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health doesn’t have to be taboo. Initiatives like this are essential, and we hope that we will find other innovative ways to support our amazing youth and help it thrive.</span></p>

<h2 id="ramps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🧱 The Grandmother Who Builds Wheelchair Ramps From LEGO Bricks</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since LEGO introduced its little bricks to the world, they have never ceased to amaze and spark creativity among kids and adults.</span></p>
<p>Rita Ebel is a 62-years old grandmother using LEGO bricks to build wheelchair ramps in her German hometown of Hanau. For each ramp, she uses several hundreds of bricks, stuck together with up to eight tubes of glue. Given how hard it can be to separate bricks from each other (we have sore fingers just thinking about it), we’ll let you imagine how solid the ramps are with all this glue 😂</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/lego-ramps.webp" alt="" width="814" height="522"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita is in a wheelchair since a car accident 25 years ago, and she was excited to witness the positive reactions around her creations. In addition to their utilitarian value, they bring a joyful atmosphere into this small town.</span></p>
<p>Businesses are thrilled to set them up as disabled people can see from afar that the shop is accessible. Also, the colourful tiny bricks attract people of all ages, who never miss a chance to take pictures.</p>
<p>Of course, there is more! Rita’s idea has sparked interest worldwide. She has sent ramp building instructions to Austria and Switzerland. She is also in contact with a school in the United States and people from Spain. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to her creativity, some plastic bricks and a lot of glue, she managed to tackle an issue that she was facing directly while raising awareness about accessibility. We're all for it 💗</span></p>

<h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.aigcs.org/students-of-the-month/july-2020-graduate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eva Dawn Burk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a graduate student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, is developing a grassroots project to build biomass-heated greenhouses in rural Native villages in Alaska. Her goal is to produce fresh food all year long while providing local jobs and mitigating wildfire risks.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/alaska.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/alaska-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/alaska-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/29/responsive/alaska-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1280"></figure>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Food insecurity is a key issue for Alaska Natives. Their traditional sources of food (e.g. salmon or moose) are being threatened by climate change, and most of these communities are only accessible by plane or boat, which prevents them from getting fresh produce readily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a systemic approach including a network of community gardens and greenhouses, training and partnerships with local farmers, Eva is hoping to bring food sovereignty to her community 🙌</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🤖 After 3 years of research and testing, LEGO has announced starting to use </span><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-ca/aboutus/sustainability/recycledmaterials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recycled plastic bottles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create their bricks. Their goal is to have all bricks made from sustainable materials by 2030. Let’s rebuild the world sustainably!</span></p>

The idea is to pursue sustainability and engage youth in sports and other healthy activities. Eat chips, help kids 😅</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🛰 The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently experimenting with a satellite… made </span><a href="https://www.labroots.com/trending/space/20734/european-space-agency-launch-satellite-plywood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from plywood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Unlike regular carbon fibre-based satellites, the “WISA Woodsat” will entirely burn up upon re-entry to Earth and prevent toxic substances from being released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐒 A team of international lawyers has drafted a law that would consider ecocide (i.e. “an act committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of long-term damage to the environment”) as an </span><a href="https://www.positive.news/society/justice/push-to-make-ecocide-a-crime-takes-major-step-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">international crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (just like war crimes or crimes against humanity). Let’s hope nations will adopt this law 🤞</span></p>

                <p>With Anick Silencieux, Founder of Support Black Charities, we talked about the non-profit sector and uncovered insights into learning while pursuing an entrepreneurial journey.</p>

<h2>About Support Black Charities</h2>
<p>The Toronto-based non-profit organization Support Black Charities is an online portal that connects Black-led, Black-serving and Black-focused charities to supporters worldwide.</p>
<p>Anick Silencieux founded the organization to give back to the non-profit sector and support her community.</p>
<p>Support Black Charities' mission is to increase charitable giving for people of African and Caribbean descent by allowing anyone to find causes that are close to them readily.</p>
<p>To support the organization, you can g<span style="font-weight: 400;">o on the website, check whom you can help, what you can do for organizations on the directory and donate to Support Black Charities.</span></p>
<h2>Insights Into Learning While Pursuing an Entrepreneurial Journey</h2>
<p>During her journey, Anick learned how to build an online platform and what <span style="font-weight: 400;">being a non-profit meant to help Black charitable organizations address their issues. Also, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">educated herself on the problems and the related solutions to provide them to others. </span></p>
<p>In our discussion, we uncovered some tips to learn continuously while building and growing an organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managing time</strong>. Having a schedule and a routine is essential to free time dedicated to learning. For instance, grouping meetings together can be useful to avoid context switching.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting feedback</strong>. While talking with the people you want to help, you should take any opportunity to understand their biggest pain points and adapt your offer accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging tools and automation</strong>. Handling everything manually is not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, you should automate as much as possible, as soon as possible, to focus your energy on learning and performing other high-value tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Asking for help</strong>. You are not supposed to learn everything by yourself. W<span style="font-weight: 400;">hen a topic is outside your area of expertise, consider reaching out to people who can provide you with insights into the subject at hand.</span></li>
<li><strong>Accepting mistakes</strong>. Mistakes happen, and you should not beat yourself up over them. The key is to learn from them and use these experiences to improve and make better decisions<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Testing your ideas early</strong>. D<span style="font-weight: 400;">on't wait for your product to be perfect. Instead, try to discard or validate your assumptions early on. The later you find out about a wrong assumption, the greater the cost. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Trusting the process</strong>. Growing an organization takes time. So be patient, appreciate what you are achieving, celebrate the victories - whatever their magnitude - and try to avoid frustration in the face of adversity.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at what you can give to people. It's not always money. It's not always your time. It's also your expertise, your knowledge. I believe everybody has something to give.</p>

<h2 id="houses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🏘 The Houses Made of Plastic Bottles</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How cool would it be if we could provide affordable and quality housing and help the youth in our communities while saving the planet?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The well-named Nigerian NGO </span><a href="http://dare-world.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DARE </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Developmental Association for Renewable Energies) accepted this challenge and had the idea to build houses using locally harvested plastic bottles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each house’s construction requires 14,000 sand-filled bottles. The builders hold these bottles together with mud, traditionally used to build houses in the region, and lattice-patterned strings.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/bottle-house.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/responsive/bottle-house-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/responsive/bottle-house-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/responsive/bottle-house-md.png 768w"  alt="" width="400" height="267"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their creators, these houses are 18 times stronger than brick and can withstand earthquakes or even bullets. They are pretty, too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ecological benefits of this technique are obvious, it’s not the whole story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project employs out-of-school and jobless youth to collect the bottles, fill them with sand and mount the structure. Last but not least, houses built with this “bottle-brick” technology cost only a third of the usual price in the region since raw materials are virtually free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria is the 7th most populated country on Earth and is expected to climb to 2nd place by 2100. Therefore, this kind of holistic initiatives could be crucial for the future of this country ✨ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: aljazeera.com)</span></p>
<h2 id="bees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐝 Following up on the Bees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, bees are not only sipping mojitos by the pool but also getting “vaccinated” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s not an actual vaccine, but please bear with us </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">😇).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/using-popcorn-as-shipping-material-and-extracting-lithium-from-seawater.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we learnt that the Netherlands is building bee hotels and a honey highway to prevent their bee population from declining. </span><a href="https://www.beemmunity.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beemmunity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Colorado-based company, took a different path and developed a pollen-sized microparticle that, when ingested, captures pesticide before it reaches the bee’s brain.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/bee-particle.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/responsive/bee-particle-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/responsive/bee-particle-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/27/responsive/bee-particle-md.png 768w"  alt="The microparticle captures pesticide before it reaches the bee’s brain." width="600" height="257"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research published in the renowned </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00282-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> journal, this antidote increases the survival rate from 0% for untreated bees to 80% for the treated ones!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deliver the microparticle to bees, the company sells a sugar bar that you can put in your garden to feed the visiting bees, as well as a sugar powder that beekeepers can apply directly into their hives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, 98% of honeycombs in North America are contaminated with pesticides, and 40% of the managed colonies are lost each year. While the long-term solution includes removing pesticides from industrial agriculture’s operations, Beemmunity’s products provide a way to mitigate the issue until then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shout out to the team for coming up with a concrete solution that is available to everyone and helps solve a pressing issue while being so cute 😍 </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">📚 A </span><a href="https://humanlibrary.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">library in Denmark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed a fascinating concept: instead of borrowing books, you can borrow time with someone who will tell you their life story. The Human Library’s goal is for people to go beyond stereotypes and stop “judging books by their cover.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♻ An Indian company, </span><a href="https://www.ecoideaz.com/green-directory/code-effort-pvt-ltd-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CODE Effort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, made more than a million dollars selling toys, furnishing and mosquito repellents... Oh, we forgot to tell you that all these items were produced from recycled cigarettes 🤯</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🥧 By studying protein interactions to understand and treat Alzheimer's disease, researchers discovered a way to </span><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/scientists-create-vegan-spider-silk-as-alternative-to-single-use-plastics-1.5467990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mimic spider silk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - one of the strongest materials in nature - to create vegan, biodegradable, soy-based plastic.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">❄ Yi Zheng, a mechanical and industrial engineering professor, has invented a material that can reflect solar rays and </span><a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/news/using-recycled-paper-to-cool-the-air/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively absorb heat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h2 id="popcorn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌽 The Packing Peanuts Made Out of Popcorn</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While enjoying a bucket of popcorn at his favourite movie theatre, Alireza Kharazipour, a German researcher at the </span><a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/3240.html?id=6256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Göttingen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, had a flash of genius: replacing polystyrene-based packing peanuts with popcorn! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make his packing popcorns, Alireza took inedible</span><strong> byproducts of cornflakes production</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and filled them with steam to give them a peanut shape. Actually, his technique allows him to create any shape he wants to protect champagne bottles, 60 inches TVs or anything else -- the sky’s the limit 🚀</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/26/popcorn-released-University-of-Gottingen.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/26/responsive/popcorn-released-University-of-Gottingen-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/26/responsive/popcorn-released-University-of-Gottingen-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/26/responsive/popcorn-released-University-of-Gottingen-md.jpg 768w"  alt="Packing popcorns look exactly the same as regular polystyrene-based packing peanuts." width="400" height="266"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular polystyrene requires fossil fuel extraction and takes centuries to break down into harmful micro-plastic. Most of the recycling facilities do not even accept processing it. On the other hand, this popcorn-based packing material is </span><strong>entirely biodegradable </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and can even be </span><strong>reused </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to create more packing popcorns ♻ Pretty awesome, eh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Göttingen already collaborates with </span><a href="https://www.nordgetreide.de/index.php?id=22&amp;L=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nordgetreide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a grain and cereal company, to make popcorn packing for commercial use. We sure hope that others will follow their lead to make a dent in the million tons of polystyrene produced each year 😍</span></p>

<h2 id="lithium"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌊 The System That Turns Seawater Into </span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lithium</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, hang on to your hats because this one literally blew our minds 🤯</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the current surge in demand for electric vehicles, battery manufacturers will require a lot of lithium. The good news is that the researchers at </span><a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1133/electrochemical-cell-harvests-lithium-from-seawater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KAUST</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a way to extract it </span><strong>from seawater</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">... for free!</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/26/kaust.jfif" alt="" width="400" height="194"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oceans contain 5,000 times more lithium than the land, but its extremely low concentration has made its extraction unviable </span><strong>until now</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers designed an electrochemical cell containing a membrane that is just wide enough to let lithium ions pass through while blocking larger metal ions. Then, by introducing an electrical current into the solution and repeating the process several times, they can retrieve a lithium solution pure enough to be used in battery manufacturing.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/26/membrane.jfif" alt="The cell designed by KAUST can separate lithium ions from seawater while also producing valuable chlorine and hydrogen." width="400" height="211"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole process costs </span><strong>only $5 of electricity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to extract 1kg of lithium (for reference, a typical car battery contains 10kg of lithium).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not even the best part!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a byproduct of extracting the lithium, the system also produces hydrogen and chlorine, whose value more than offsets the cost of extraction… making the lithium effectively </span><strong>free</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention it avoids the drawbacks mining can have, such as impacting biodiversity and local communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it over yet? Of course not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residual seawater can finally be used in desalination plants to </span><strong>provide freshwater</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 💧</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science rocks. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday was World Environment Day! For the occasion, we learnt that we throw away 2.12 billion tons of waste every year and discovered fantastic initiatives trying to change that.</span></p>

<h2 id="face-masks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌱 The Face Masks That Turn Into Trees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting </span><strong>seeds in face masks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: that’s the original idea the Indian NGO Paper Seed Co. implemented to fight the pollution generated by the tons of single-use face masks dumped during the pandemic. Indeed, some studies showed that we are currently using 3 million face masks per minute and discarding several billion every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Paper Seed masks are mostly made of cotton and are </span><strong>entirely biodegradable</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When thrown into the soil, they will germinate in a few days. Also, according to their creator, they are “as thick as N95 and protect from the infection”.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As good news never come alone, the NGO produces the masks in a small village, generating a revenue stream for locals, </span><strong>mostly women and youth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pretty neat, isn’t it?</span></p>

<h2 id="cleanup-ocean"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🧹 The Company That Wants to Clean up the Ocean</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ocean Cleanup is a Dutch non-profit organization aiming to clean up 90% of the floating plastic pollution in our oceans -- easy peasy lemon squeezy 🍋. To achieve this feat, they want to intervene in the ocean itself to remove the existing plastic and in the rivers to prevent the plastic from entering the ocean in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ocean, they associated a cork floater that passively filters plastic - without harming the aquatic wildlife - with a “parachute” that slows down the system so that the current can trap the plastic into the floater. Once it is full, a boat comes and collects the “garbage”.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/1-Clean-Ocean.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Ocean-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Ocean-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Ocean-md.jpg 768w"  alt="System to gather floating plastic pollution in the ocean" width="516" height="405"></figure>Otherwise, they aim to deploy “interceptors” in the 1,000 most polluted rivers worldwide within the next 5 years. Basically, the system consists of a couple of fixed floaters that redirect the waste into conveyor belts collecting the plastic.</p>

                <p>With Hillary Scanlon, Founder and CEO at STIL Solutions, we discussed how to bridge the gap between accessibility and sustainability and uncovered insights into turning barriers to (sustainability) behaviours into business opportunities.</p>

<h2>About STIL Solutions</h2>
<p>STIL (<em>Sustainability Through an Inclusive Lens</em>) Solutions founder Hillary Scanlon lost her vision unexpectedly and suddenly in 2016. Hillary, only one year later, turned her frustration with the inaccessibility of built-in environments and the inability to participate in sustainability initiatives into a business opportunity.</p>
<p>Her social enterprise intends to bridge the gap between sustainability and accessibility in the area of waste management. It provides organizations with WasteFinder, a shape-and-colour-based waste management system for public spaces, accessible to people of all abilities.</p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/WasteFinder.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-md.jpg 768w"  alt="WasteFinder" width="1024" height="683">
<figcaption >WasteFinder installed in a public space.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>STIL Solutions has already been working with 18 customers across Ontario, creating more inclusive spaces for people with vision loss, people living with blindness, young children who cannot yet read, or people who do not speak the language commonly used on signage. It also contributes to the standardization of waste management.</p>
<p>The end goal is to "empower everyone to be a steward of their environment and divert as much waste as possible from landfill." Hillary wants to make all public spaces accessible to people of all abilities from a sustainability perspective for the years to come.<br><br>To support STIL Solutions, follow them on Instagram and check out their website. You can also spread the word about their initiative and contact them if you want to implement their solution!</p>
<h2 class="align-left">Insights Into Turning Lack of Accessibility Into Business Opportunities</h2>
<h3>Barrier Identification</h3>
<p>It comes down to understanding the behaviours necessary for the cause you want to participate in (e.g. being more environmentally friendly) and asking yourself whether everyone can participate in that cause, regardless of their ability.</p>
<p>By applying this approach to your context, you can turn barriers into business opportunities by removing them. "It is important to recognize these gaps and act upon them," Hillary underlines.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging Some Potential Challenges</h3>
<p>Sometimes, technology might not always be the answer to your problem. For instance, Hillary wants to address the accessibility of built-in environments to participate in sustainability initiatives and did not want to "place the responsibility of accessibility on the individual with the disability to have data on their phone and download an app."</p>
<p>However, it can be more challenging to access funding without it. Also, when tapping into something innovative, it might become imperative to spend time and resources educating people to build credibility instead of focusing solely on growing. Moreover, very few women-led startups receive VC funding.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it can be easy to burn out while running a low-tech social enterprise as a woman.</p>
<h3>Ideas To Help You Thrive</h3>
<p>We uncovered a set of factors that might help you thrive, despite the difficulties.</p>
<p>First, it is crucial to understand that you need to <strong>enjoy the process</strong> and not only the end goal itself. So, make sure to put systems in place to enjoy your entrepreneurial journey and take care of yourself along the way. </p>
<p>Also, having a clear<strong> understanding </strong>of what you are trying to achieve is necessary to ensure your actions are always aligned with your objectives and avoid strategic drift.</p>
<p>Finally, constant and ongoing <strong>communication</strong> with the community and stakeholders is essential. Hillary highlights that "people with disabilities with diverse backgrounds and experiences" informed all of her business decisions. She indicates this has allowed her to ensure her products will make a real impact. So, be always open to expanding your network and gathering feedback.</p>
<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Disability is one of the only marginalized identities that we are all going to experience at some point in our lives because of injuries, temporary illnesses, age, among others. So, even if you think that this might not apply to you now, it is within everyone's best interest to make the environment more accessible.</p>

                <p>With Charlene Nadalin, Founder and CEO at Amintro, we talked about the reality of social isolation and uncovered insights into building a sustainable free platform to genuinely help people while generating enough revenues to sustain your purpose.</p>

<h2>About Amintro</h2>
<p>What started as a desire to help Amintro founder Charlene Nadalin's mother became a concrete initiative to foster friendship among people over 50 in North America.</p>
<p>Amintro from Latin <em>amica - introduction</em> (literally <em>friends</em> - <em>introduction</em>) provides baby boomers and seniors with a free platform to let them find a group of friends with which they can share time and experiences to avoid loneliness and social isolation. It also features relevant editorial content about how to live healthier and happier.</p>
<p>"The reality is that social isolation and loneliness is a global epidemic," Charlene says. Amintro envisions becoming a global brand and solution to help seniors and their families.</p>
<p>To support Amintro, Charlene underlines you can spread the word about their social platform to create more opportunities for people to connect and contact them if you want to become part of the solution.</p>
<h2>Insights Into Building a Sustainable Free Platform</h2>
<p>You can stay true to your values and develop an inclusive and sustainable business without having to opt for a freemium model.</p>
<p>To do so, you need to define <strong>one </strong>revenue model and roll it out to develop and test your platform, Charlene shares. The idea is to understand the relevance of other potential revenue models and discover new revenue streams along the way. She highlights that you can only do so once you have built your product.</p>
<p><strong>So,</strong> <strong>how to develop a relevant and robust first revenue model?</strong></p>
<p>If possible, leverage your previous experiences and professional network to define the clientele that will help you keep the platform free.</p>
<p>Charlene used her extensive marketing and editorial sales experience to develop partnerships with organisations that sponsor the content in her platform, helping her sustain Amintro. "You need to know your clientele, understand their needs and pain points. [I realised that] I had a network of past clients who may benefit from what we are doing at Amintro," she explains.</p>
<p>Amintro's partners include financial institutions, insurance companies, travel agencies, food manufacturers, among others, that provide services and products to support her target demographic. Note that these partnerships are also <strong>aligned</strong> with the company's purpose as they allow giving seniors access to valuable information for their mental and physical well-being.</p>
<p>In terms of marketing, your positioning can significantly differ between your clientele and the people you want to support.</p>
<p>To scale up your purpose and increase your impact, it might be necessary to consider fundraising. "We have identified other opportunities for our stakeholders that will generate revenue, and we are [, therefore,] going into fundraising to build out our intellectual property and technology".</p>
<p>During the whole process, do not hesitate to look out for help in the areas that you do not know well, use the available resources, and build relationships with people who share your values.</p>
<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I have learned through all of this that people want to see you succeed and are generous with their knowledge and experience. They are very much willing and happy to answer your questions or to provide some form of assistance, whatever that may be. That is not something that I realised before starting the company.</p>
