                <p>In Shanghai, Home of Hope is the city's first dance group that includes only people with paraplegia, aiming to reshape perceptions of accessibility in China.</p>

<p>After a car accident in 2012, Pan Jing—a Chinese professional dancer—undertook spinal cord rehabilitation at Shanghai's Sunshine Medical Rehabilitation Centre. There, she had the idea to create dance routines for people in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Since forming in 2014, the dancers have performed more than 70 shows, including some on national television. The group inspired many patients along the way and helped its members process their traumatic experiences. Today, the people involved hope its influence will spread outside of the program to reach more people with disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In China, people with disabilities often encounter physical and social barriers as the country has stigmatized disability for a long time. Indeed, the official term to refer to people with disabilities until the mid-1980s was "<em>Canfei"—</em>a combination of two Chinese characters meaning "incomplete" and "useless."</p>
<p>Home of Hope is a safe space where its members feel accepted and understood. They hope their performances can play a part in changing Chinese society's views regarding disabilities.</p>

<p>There, you can drop off old toys, furniture, clothes, decorative items, and electronic devices in the mall's depot. Then, the organization distributes the reusable items to the mall's recycling shops that fix them up and resell them.</p>
<p>Through this cycle, ReTuna has created a one-stop-shop to recycle unwanted goods and buy something "new" in the process—giving old items a new life and reducing our environmental footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Almost 60% of the world's waste ends up in landfills, eventually releasing toxins that contaminate the soil and groundwater and emitting dangerous greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>ReTuna Återbruksgalleria revolutionizes shopping in a climate-smart way by keeping items in perfect condition out of the landfills—and participating in the Swedish <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/whats-up-this-week-bhutan-is-the-worlds-first-carbon-negative-country-and-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recycling revolution</a>.</p>

<p>Vaitea Cowan, the co-founder, was born in New Caledonia, where climate change—the sea-level rise in particular—is a pressing existential threat to the entire population. Her goal was to replace all the diesel generators in New Caledonia's remote areas with green energy.</p>
<p>Enapter's technology is an ion exchange membrane electrolyzer that uses renewable electricity to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the water. According to their research, a generator can power a home for several days with just 2.4 litres of water—half of what we need to flush a toilet once.</p>
<p>The company has deployed its innovation across 33 countries and expects to start mass production in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> About 80 percent of global energy consumption still relies on fossil fuels. Green hydrogen is poised to be a credible alternative, but some researchers have criticized the currently available technologies for their low efficiency and high cost.</p>
<p>Enapter claims its AEM Electrolyser solves these issues and provides an economically attractive way to produce clean energy, even at home.</p>

                    <p>In the past few weeks, British Columbia witnessed the worst floods in recorded history, leading to the evacuation of nearly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/flooding-mudslides-bc-by-the-numbers-1.6252453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 people</a> and $1 billion in damages.</p>

<p>Also, two weeks after the first rainfalls, Vancouver is still virtually inaccessible by road from the rest of the country—forcing the government to impose <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/natural-disaster/support/restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">restrictions</a> on fuel and travel.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Nowadays, floods create more damage than before because of a combination of factors.</p>
<ol>
<li>Forests can naturally slow water down, absorb it and release it gradually over several days. But, <strong>human intervention</strong> remodelled the landscape and replaced these forests with paved areas that redirect water straight into rivers and lakes, overflowing them in the process.</li>
<li>The <strong>growing population</strong> led to the creation of entire neighbourhoods in areas with a significant risk of flooding. Each flood can also affect more people since urban areas are denser and denser.</li>
<li>As a result, floods would be more serious even without climate change. However, <strong>global warming</strong> also plays its part by evaporating more water from the ocean and letting the warmer atmosphere hold a greater volume of water, increasing rainfalls' intensity. Moreover, droughts make the soil extremely dry and compact—impeding its ability to absorb and retain water.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a nutshell, global warming worsens the rainfalls, and many factors reduce the land's ability to drain water properly. In British Columbia, the main causes for these extreme floods include the proximity to the ocean, intensive logging, and having drained the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumas_Lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sumas Lake</a> artificially to create fertile farmlands 100 years ago. Last week, the overflow from the nearby rivers refilled the Sumas Lake, as anticipated by a <a href="https://www.abbotsford.ca/sites/default/files/2021-02/Nooksack%20Overflow%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 report</a>.</p>
<p>With work from home becoming more pervasive, we don't necessarily need to live in urban areas anymore—helping us build a world more resilient towards floods.</p>

<p>There, you can drop off old toys, furniture, clothes, decorative items, and electronic devices in the mall's depot. Then, the organization distributes the reusable items to the mall's recycling shops that fix them up and resell them.</p>
<p>Through this cycle, ReTuna has created a one-stop-shop to recycle unwanted goods and buy something "new" in the process—giving old items a new life and reducing our environmental footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Almost 60% of the world's waste ends up in landfills, eventually releasing toxins that contaminate the soil and groundwater and emitting dangerous greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>ReTuna Återbruksgalleria revolutionizes shopping in a climate-smart way by keeping items in perfect condition out of the landfills—and participating in the Swedish <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/whats-up-this-week-bhutan-is-the-worlds-first-carbon-negative-country-and-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recycling revolution</a>.</p>

<p>After a car accident in 2012, Pan Jing—a Chinese professional dancer—undertook spinal cord rehabilitation at Shanghai's Sunshine Medical Rehabilitation Centre. There, she had the idea to create dance routines for people in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Since forming in 2014, the dancers have performed more than 70 shows, including some on national television. The group inspired many patients along the way and helped its members process their traumatic experiences. Today, the people involved hope its influence will spread outside of the program to reach more people with disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In China, people with disabilities often encounter physical and social barriers as the country has stigmatized disability for a long time. Indeed, the official term to refer to people with disabilities until the mid-1980s was "<em>Canfei"—</em>a combination of two Chinese characters meaning "incomplete" and "useless." Today, things are shifting, and several groups are pushing to start using other terms.</p>
<p>Home of Hope is a safe space where its members feel accepted and understood. They hope their performances can play a part in changing Chinese society's views regarding disabilities.</p>

This extension aims to make movies accessible to audiences who cannot hear and read subtitles (e.g. young deaf viewers).</p>
<p>✈ Alaska Airlines is the first major airline to eliminate plastic cups to serve water to passengers. The company estimates that this measure will save <a href="https://blog.alaskaair.com/values/fly-greener/reducing-onboard-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">800,000 kg</a> of single-use plastic each year.</p>
<p>🌳 In the UK, Hugh Huddy and Madeleine Sugden created a podcast that features the sounds of the landscapes the family has discovered on walks and other trips. Eighteen months after its launch, <a href="https://radiolento.podbean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Lento</a> already hit 117,000 downloads!</p>

                <p>In France, <a href="https://www.lesartsverts-torreilles.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Les Arts Verts</a> grow tropical produce in greenhouses to reduce the carbon footprint associated with importing food from around the globe.</p>

<p>These pioneer farmers in the Pyrenees produce bananas, turmeric, passionfruit, mangos, and many other species that we usually find in La Réunion (a French department in the Indian Ocean). Their secret is to find species that can handle conditions colder than the tropics to flourish in European greenhouses.</p>
<p>Moreover, Les Arts Verts grow their food according to the organic certification ECOCERT. In particular, they cultivate their tropical produce in living spaces, using polyculture to keep the soil rich and increase biodiversity. Also, they do not heat their greenhouses but equip them with solar panels to put clean electricity back into the grid.</p>
<p>Finally, this farm collaborates with the greatest French chefs—including a Michelin-starred restaurant— to provide them with zero-carbon exotic products.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Bananas and mangos are among the preferred fruits in France. The country imports <a href="https://www.fruitlogistica.com/FRUIT-LOGISTICA/Downloads-Alle-Sprachen/Auf-einen-Blick/European_Statistics_Handbook_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3.4 million metric tons of fruit</a> every year, despite the vast amount of farms within its borders. However, importing 2 tons of products can generate 6 tons of carbon dioxide and its greenhouse gas equivalent.</p>
<p>Eco-conscious consumers in France will now be able to get their favourite tropical fruits while enabling the creation of local jobs and preventing adverse effects on the environment.</p>

                <p>Today, 80% of Napa Valley winemakers use owls to control their rodent population, while less than 20% use rodenticide instead.</p>

<p>Farmers realized that they only needed to build nest boxes near their fields to attract owls and reap the benefits. For example, a farmer with 20 owl boxes can expect those owls to catch around 70,000 rodents per year — which represents a cost of 26 cents per rodent, against several dollars for traditional methods (e.g. trapping, rodenticide).</p>
<p>Replacing pesticides with barn owls for rodent control is part of a broader environmentally sustainable trend among Napa Valley farmers. Indeed, many also reduce their water consumption in the face of Californian droughts and plant perennial grass between rows to prevent the dangers of monoculture.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> For decades, Napa Valley's wineries relied on pesticides to prevent rodents from damaging their crops. However, this strategy, coupled with grapes-only monoculture and the usage of commercial fertilizer, generated a toxic taint in certain wines, demonstrating the need for more sustainable practices. In January 2021, California passed a law restricting rodenticides, but lobbying created a loophole for agricultural use.</p>
<p>Although still technically authorized, Napa's growers turned away from rodenticides because they understood that people and nature depend on each other to thrive. Also, they took this opportunity to make a few raptor friends along the way.</p>

                <p>American designer and entrepreneur <a href="https://joedoucet.com/index#/windturbinewall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Doucet</a> created a concept of a wind turbine that fits into a wall.</p>

<p>This "kinetic wall" comprises an array of rotary blades that spin individually, driving a mini generator that creates electricity. The electricity can then power the building to which the wall belongs or go back into the national grid, generating a new revenue stream for the owner.</p>
<p>However, this device is not only aesthetically pleasing. Indeed, one wall is enough to cover the energy needs of an average American home. Moreover, deploying such walls along roads and highways would be highly effective, as they would benefit from the natural wind and the one generated by the trucks and cars passing by.</p>
<p>Joe is currently working with several manufacturers to help him develop and commercialize this exciting product.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Wind energy plays a significant part in reducing the world's dependency on fossil fuels. However, wind turbines for homes have encountered very slow uptake due, in part, to their intrusive physicality. As a result, wind turbines flourish mainly offshore, where nobody can see them. This situation leads to wasting potential energy sources in cities prone to strong winds, such as Wellington (New Zealand), Perth (Australia), Chicago or Boston (USA).</p>
<p>Joe's kinetic wall can be a gamechanger in these urban areas by covering all their energy needs.</p>

Since public transit infrastructure already exists, promoting such incentives is significantly cheaper for the city than advertising electric vehicles.</li>
<li>Paris invested $260 million to become 100% bicycle-friendly by 2026. The "Plan Velo: Act 2" is part of a greater endeavour to remove cars from the city centre, including transforming the Champs-Élysées avenue into a vast community garden.</li>
<li>Thanks to environmental education and new legislation that criminalizes poaching and consuming turtles, the number of loggerhead sea turtle nests on Cap Verde beaches increased by 2000% <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/26/fragile-success-cape-verde-sea-turtles-aoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the past six years</a>.</li>
<li>In a highly successful trial, a ship operated by <a href="https://socialimpactguild.com/the-company-that-wants-to-clean-up-the-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ocean Cleanup</a> brought almost 30 tonnes of trash ashore. As a result, the non-profit organization now wants to scale up the operation to clean up the Great Pacific garbage patch.</li>
<li>Scientists studying carbon sequestration discovered that whales account for around <a href="https://farallones.org/climate/blue-carbon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60 percent of annual sequestration</a> in the areas they live – more than seagrass, salt marshes and kelp put together.
