                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based organization </span><a href="https://www.ecologicstudio.com/projects/airbubble-playground-and-exhibition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed a children's play centre called AirBubble that uses algae in solar-powered bioreactors to remove pollutants from the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar energy powers photosynthesis by which algae split carbon dioxide into carbon, which it uses to feed, and oxygen, which it releases into the room. On the other hand, the children's play activates machinery that moves liquid through the bioreactors, ensuring proper aeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the designer, the system can filter up to 200 litres of air per minute and purify the entire structure in less than 24h, driving pollution levels down to within World Health Organization guidelines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this process transforms pollutants into biomass, a raw material for bioplastics, food supplements, natural cosmetics and more. So, we ultimately end up with usable byproducts instead of waste.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio chose to install AirBubble in Warsaw, Poland, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, to educate people about air quality in a playful way. Indeed, the link between urban air quality, respiratory health and public well-being has become more evident during Covid, and tackling this issue is crucial for our future. Also, the organization wants to inspire future generations to find innovative solutions for our current problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In urban areas, most of our trips are less than a few kilometres long. Using public transportation, biking or walking for these trips can go a long way to reducing pollution. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using an electric vehicle is also highly effective. Indeed, thermic cars are particularly suboptimal for short travels involving many stops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, studies showed that planting </span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/can-tiny-forests-breathe-fresh-air-into-our-cities/a-57608913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny forests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cities can improve biodiversity, air quality and even our well-being. As citizens of these cities, we can vote and advocate to move these initiatives forward.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoever spends time with kids realizes that they are an inextinguishable source of energy. This fantastic project leverages this energy to provide our children with a pure atmosphere and educate them on the importance of air quality.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, </span><a href="https://www.lovedbefore.london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loved Before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened a “soft toy adoption agency” to promote sustainability in the industry and give preloved toys a second life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creator, Charlotte Liebling, witnessed the massive amount of toys donated and thrown away when she worked in a charity shop. Her social enterprise wants to encourage people to buy pre-owned soft toys and change the perceptions around second-hand items. Indeed, she asks previous owners to provide toys’ back story to add a sentimental value that brand new toys don’t possess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meteoric success of this company <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> from 20 new toys per week last year to 1,000 today <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> proves that people are now ready to change how they consume.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plush toy market is valued at around $10 billion and grows 7% each year. However, their production requires a large amount of water and energy, and most of the time, they include petrol-based polyester. Moreover, a </span><a href="https://www.charityretail.org.uk/british-heart-foundation-calls-on-parents-to-donate-unwanted-toys-this-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that 50% of children are tired of a new toy after only a week and 25% of parents throw away perfectly good items that end up in a landfill.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can donate our unused toys to charity, schools or social enterprises like Loved Before instead of throwing them away. This simple action will not only benefit the environment but also bring joy to other people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies, such as LEGO or Mattel, also have toy recycling schemes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, many cities worldwide feature toy hospitals that can repair and clean the toys we want to keep and pass on to the next generation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Internet is full of DIY videos and posts that explain how to use old toys to build new furniture and decorative objects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between a toy and its owner goes beyond the utilitarian aspect. Charlotte’s wholesome initiative enables perpetuating our memories while reducing the environmental footprint of the toy industry.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the United States, hospitals rely more and more on Virtual Reality (VR) headsets to relieve their patients' pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Gold, a doctor at the </span><a href="https://www.chla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children's Hospital Los Angeles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, believes that virtual reality can eliminate the need for billions of dollars worth of pain management drugs. So, he developed a game in cooperation with the software company </span><a href="https://appliedvr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied VR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and uses it with his young patients when they undergo medical procedures, such as IV preparation or bandages replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explains that pain highly depends on the context. Indeed, pain is more acute when we are stressed out or overly focused on it. But, on the other hand, our body produces natural endorphins, which are a neurochemical analgesic, when we’re having fun.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/43/3/266/4558507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrate that VR <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> especially interactive games <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> is significantly more effective than any other distraction for pain management. Indeed, our brain is unable to tell the difference between a virtual and a real environment.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR can have a broad range of usages, from purely managing pain to eliminating anxiety or simply distracting a kid to make them stay still. Whatever the use case, it always reduces the need for drugs and prevents the associated side effects (e.g. adverse reaction, addiction). Also, using VR before surgeries can lead to shorter recovery times and better overall postoperative outcomes. Otherwise, nurses and doctors are more relaxed and are in better dispositions to do a great job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a refreshing change of pace to see video games and technology being praised for their health benefits, especially when it means reducing the need for pain medication and sedation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Gold, a doctor at the </span><a href="https://www.chla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children's Hospital Los Angeles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, believes that virtual reality can eliminate the need for billions of dollars worth of pain management drugs. So, he developed a game in cooperation with the software company </span><a href="https://appliedvr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied VR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and uses it with his young patients when they undergo medical procedures, such as IV preparation or bandages replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explains that pain highly depends on the context. Indeed, pain is more acute when we are stressed out or overly focused on it. But, on the other hand, our body produces natural endorphins, which are a neurochemical analgesic, when we’re having fun.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/43/3/266/4558507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrate that VR <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> especially interactive games <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> is significantly more effective than any other distraction for pain management. Indeed, our brain is unable to tell the difference between a virtual and a real environment.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR can have a broad range of usages, from purely managing pain to eliminating anxiety or simply distracting a kid to make them stay still. Whatever the use case, it always reduces the need for drugs and prevents the associated side effects (e.g. adverse reaction, addiction). Also, using VR before surgeries can lead to shorter recovery times and better overall postoperative outcomes. Otherwise, nurses and doctors are more relaxed and are in better dispositions to do a great job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a refreshing change of pace to see video games and technology being praised for their health benefits, especially when it means reducing the need for pain medication and sedation.</span></p>

<h2 id="toys"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐻 The Adoption Agency for Preloved Teddy Bears</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/teddy-bear-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1439" height="810"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, </span><a href="https://www.lovedbefore.london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loved Before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened a “soft toy adoption agency” to promote sustainability in the industry and give preloved toys a second life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creator, Charlotte Liebling, witnessed the massive amount of toys donated and thrown away when she worked in a charity shop. Her social enterprise wants to encourage people to buy pre-owned soft toys and change the perceptions around second-hand items. Indeed, she asks previous owners to provide toys’ back story to add a sentimental value that brand new toys don’t possess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meteoric success of this company <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> from 20 new toys per week last year to 1,000 today <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> proves that people are now ready to change how they consume.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plush toy market is valued at around $10 billion and grows 7% each year. However, their production requires a large amount of water and energy, and most of the time, they include petrol-based polyester. Moreover, a </span><a href="https://www.charityretail.org.uk/british-heart-foundation-calls-on-parents-to-donate-unwanted-toys-this-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that 50% of children are tired of a new toy after only a week and 25% of parents throw away perfectly good items that end up in a landfill.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can donate our unused toys to charity, schools or social enterprises like Loved Before instead of throwing them away. This simple action will not only benefit the environment but also bring joy to other people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies, such as LEGO or Mattel, also have toy recycling schemes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, many cities worldwide feature toy hospitals that can repair and clean the toys we want to keep and pass on to the next generation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Internet is full of DIY videos and posts that explain how to use old toys to build new furniture and decorative objects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between a toy and its owner goes beyond the utilitarian aspect. Charlotte’s wholesome initiative enables perpetuating our memories while reducing the environmental footprint of the toy industry.</span></p>

<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/algae.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="851" height="479"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based organization </span><a href="https://www.ecologicstudio.com/projects/airbubble-playground-and-exhibition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed a children's play centre called AirBubble that uses algae in solar-powered bioreactors to remove pollutants from the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar energy powers photosynthesis by which algae split carbon dioxide into carbon, which it uses to feed, and oxygen, which it releases into the room. On the other hand, the children's play activates machinery that moves liquid through the bioreactors, ensuring proper aeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the designer, the system can filter up to 200 litres of air per minute and purify the entire structure in less than 24h, driving pollution levels down to within World Health Organization guidelines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this process transforms pollutants into biomass, a raw material for bioplastics, food supplements, natural cosmetics and more. So, we ultimately end up with usable byproducts instead of waste.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio chose to install AirBubble in Warsaw, Poland, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, to educate people about air quality in a playful way. Indeed, the link between urban air quality, respiratory health and public well-being has become more evident during Covid, and tackling this issue is crucial for our future. Also, the organization wants to inspire future generations to find innovative solutions for our current problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In urban areas, most of our trips are less than a few kilometres long. Using public transportation, biking or walking for these trips can go a long way to reducing pollution. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using an electric vehicle is also highly effective. Indeed, thermic cars are particularly suboptimal for short travels involving many stops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, studies showed that planting </span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/can-tiny-forests-breathe-fresh-air-into-our-cities/a-57608913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny forests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cities can improve biodiversity, air quality and even our well-being. As citizens of these cities, we can vote and advocate to move these initiatives forward.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoever spends time with kids realizes that they are an inextinguishable source of energy. This fantastic project leverages this energy to provide our children with a pure atmosphere and educate them on the importance of air quality.</span></p>

<h2 id="worldwide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide …</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🚀 Researchers from The University of Texas have found a low-cost and efficient way to split off oxygen molecules </span><a href="https://cockrell.utexas.edu/news/archive/9300-making-clean-hydrogen-is-hard-but-researchers-just-solved-a-major-hurdle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from water using sunlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This discovery solves a significant hurdle to sustainably producing hydrogen from water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">📌 Google Maps will show the </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90683605/google-maps-can-now-show-you-the-most-fuel-efficient-route" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most fuel-efficient route</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside the fastest one and the amount of fuel you can save with a slight detour. This new release also indicates flights’ CO2 emissions, sustainability information about hotels and businesses, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♻ In Denmark, the </span><a href="https://www.re-wind.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-Wind Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores ways to reuse old wind blades in architectural and engineering structures, such as protective bike shelters or pedestrian bridges. Indeed, it wasn’t possible to recycle these blades until recently. Therefore, most of them ended up in the landfill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🚄 The French National Railway Company (SNCF) </span><a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/10/01/after-40-years-in-a-graveyard-these-french-trains-are-coming-back-to-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kickstarted an initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to recycle the 5,000 unused rail cars collecting dust and rust throughout the country. The company pledged to find a new purpose for all of those trains by 2028.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌊 Scientists in the US designed a system that can filter out microplastics from water without ever clogging. This mechanism mimics how </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-environment-58573451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manta rays filter out plankton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using a complex pattern of whirlpools that moves the microplastics away from the filter.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Netherlands, the supermarket chain Jumbo opens tills where clients can take their time and chat instead of rushing to pay for their groceries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This "Kletskassa" (or "Chat Checkout") initiative is part of the Dutch government's "One Against Loneliness" campaign that aims to fight against isolation amongst the elderly population. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this time next year, Jumbo hopes to install chat checkouts in 200 stores across the country, in areas where loneliness is particularly present. Moreover, some stores will feature a chat corner where customers can have a coffee and chat with their neighbours.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1.3 million people in the Netherlands (~7% of the population) are older than 75 years, and 33% expressed they felt lonely. Going to the supermarket is one of the rare social interactions they have during their day, so this environment seems like a natural fit to implement such initiatives.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help?<br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many other initiatives exist worldwide to help us prevent loneliness for our loved ones. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The younger among us can look for local nursing homes that connect students with the elderly in exchange for affordable accommodation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, some postal companies offer services where their employees have conversations with people living alone while delivering mail. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, we can set reminders to regularly call our older relatives, who can sometimes be uncomfortable asking for help.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company's biodegradable microcapsules can prove extremely useful for many industries. For instance, laundry detergent manufacturers use microcapsules to retain fragrance for longer. Also, farmers utilize them to slowly release active compounds, reducing the amount required to treat their crops.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, Calyxia is developing coatings that would prevent plastic products from eventually disintegrating.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Microcapsules traditionally contain plastic that breaks up into microplastics. These small pieces of plastic then end up down the drain or in our food, harming aquatic life and our health. Also, industries will have to find alternatives before the EU's microplastic ban takes effect in 2022.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant part of the microplastics we generate in our day-to-day lives come from our clothes. We can reduce them by running our washing machines with a lower setting to limit the force with which our clothes are thrown around. We can also invest in</span><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/microplastics-laundry-filters-dramatically-reduce-fibres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">filters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or plastic-free clothes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other sources of microplastics include single-use plastic and car tires. When possible, we could therefore choose reusable containers and take public transportation.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology achieves this feat via the ionization of an electrolyte made up of salt water, transforming the magnesium on the inside into electrical energy - around 500 watts for each litre of water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by their artwork, this device underwent a pilot phase in the Wayúu, an indigenous community living on La Guajira peninsula near the Colombia-Venezuela border.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot was a tremendous success. Now, the companies want to scale this concept for many developing nations such as Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Gabon, Somalia and Syria that lack access to energy but do have a coastline.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization, 840 million people worldwide have limited access to electricity, which significantly impedes their ability to work, study and live properly after sunset and stay connected to the rest of the world. Also, electricity demand will increase by 70% by 2035, and traditional fossil fuel reserves should deplete in the next 50 years.</span></p>

<h2 id="trends"><span style="font-weight: 400;">📈 Uplifting Trends and Facts</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a study, marine life could fully recover its abundance, structure and function </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2146-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2050</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by mitigating major pressures through sustainable fishing policies and pollution regulation.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New research suggests that the African tropical mountain forests store </span><a href="https://www.theplanetarypress.com/2021/09/african-tropical-mountain-forests-store-far-more-carbon-than-previously-thought-new-research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">far more carbon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than we previously thought. Indeed, although these mountain forests have fewer trees than their lowland counterparts, their trees are larger on average, allowing them to sequestrate more carbon.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Zurich is the first city to require new public buildings to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-27/using-recycled-concrete-for-sustainable-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> use recycled concrete</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The city hopes that others will follow its lead to reduce emissions related to cement production, currently representing 6% to 8% of global emissions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A discovery about</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98148-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">algae reproduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could help save corals. Researchers hope to create a symbiosis that will boost the corals' resilience more efficiently by breeding algae instead of focusing on corals.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">UNESCO recently declared "the</span><a href="http://www.amazon-of-europe.com/en/biosphere-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon of Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" a Biosphere Reserve. This one-million-hectare area spans 5 Eastern European countries (Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Serbia) and is one of Europe's richest landscapes in terms of species and habitats.</span></li>

<h2 id="capsule"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♻ The Startup That Wants to End Microplastic</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/laundry.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/laundry-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/laundry-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/laundry-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French startup</span><a href="https://calyxia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calyxia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invented the world's first customizable, advanced and sustainable microencapsulation technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company's biodegradable microcapsules can prove extremely useful for many industries. For instance, laundry detergent manufacturers use microcapsules to retain fragrance for longer. Also, farmers utilize them to slowly release active compounds, reducing the amount required to treat their crops.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, Calyxia is developing coatings that would prevent plastic products from eventually disintegrating.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Microcapsules traditionally contain plastic that breaks up into microplastics. These small pieces of plastic then end up down the drain or in our food, harming aquatic life and our health. Also, industries will have to find alternatives before the EU's microplastic ban takes effect in 2022.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant part of the microplastics we generate in our day-to-day lives come from our clothes. We can reduce them by running our washing machines with a lower setting to limit the force with which our clothes are thrown around. We can also invest in</span><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/microplastics-laundry-filters-dramatically-reduce-fibres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">filters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or plastic-free clothes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other sources of microplastics include single-use plastic and car tires. When possible, we could therefore choose reusable containers and take public transportation.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/chat-checkout.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/chat-checkout-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/chat-checkout-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/chat-checkout-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1112" height="626"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Netherlands, the supermarket chain Jumbo opens tills where clients can take their time and chat instead of rushing to pay for their groceries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This "Kletskassa" (or "Chat Checkout") initiative is part of the Dutch government's "One Against Loneliness" campaign that aims to fight against isolation amongst the elderly population. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this time next year, Jumbo hopes to install chat checkouts in 200 stores across the country, in areas where loneliness is particularly present. Moreover, some stores will feature a chat corner where customers can have a coffee and chat with their neighbours.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1.3 million people in the Netherlands (~7% of the population) are older than 75 years, and 33% expressed they felt lonely. Going to the supermarket is one of the rare social interactions they have during their day, so this environment seems like a natural fit to implement such initiatives.</span></p>
<p><strong>How can we help?<br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many other initiatives exist worldwide to help us prevent loneliness for our loved ones. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The younger among us can look for local nursing homes that connect students with the elderly in exchange for affordable accommodation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, some postal companies offer services where their employees have conversations with people living alone while delivering mail. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, we can set reminders to regularly call our older relatives, who can sometimes be uncomfortable asking for help.</span></li>

<h2 id="worldwide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide …</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🍌 In Vancouver, the Food Stash Foundation opened the "</span><a href="https://www.foodstash.ca/market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rescued Food Market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,"  a grocery store that only sells surplus food from farms, grocers and wholesalers. Moreover, this market uses a "pay what you feel" model to increase food security and reduce food waste in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐄 A Swedish startup,</span><a href="https://www.voltagreentech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volta Greentech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, realized that a particular type of seaweed could reduce cows' methane emissions by 80%. Indeed, feeding cows only 100 g of this supplement suppresses the enzyme responsible for methane creation, leading to more sustainable dairy and beef farming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">💧 </span><a href="https://www.turbulent.be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turbulent Hydro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed eco-friendly water turbines that sit next to rivers or canals. By using vortex technology, these turbines can generate up to 100 kW without damaging the local ecosystem as they allow fish and debris to pass through. Also, they can operate under floods and freezing conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">👚 Nav Sawhney, an English engineer, launched the</span><a href="https://thewashingmachineproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washing Machine Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide displaced and low-income communities with an accessible, off-grid washing solution. The goal is to improve the well-being and livelihood of the people (usually women) that handwash clothes in these communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🔋 Researchers from the</span><a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/a-spoonful-of-sugar-opens-a-path-to-longer-lasting-lithium-sulfur-batteries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monash Energy Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discovered that sugar is highly effective in stabilizing lithium-sulphur batteries, a lighter and more sustainable alternative to the traditional lithium-ion batteries. This discovery opens new horizons for this next generation of batteries that store 2 to 5 more energy than the current ones.</span></p>
<h2 id="wholesome"><span style="font-weight: 400;">😍 Wholesomeness</span></h2>
