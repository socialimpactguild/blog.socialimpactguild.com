                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese "Typoonshot" project aims to mitigate typhoon-related risks and harness their energy to help the country reach zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the brand new Typhoon Science and Technology Research Center at </span><a href="https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/" target="null"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yokohama National University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers, analysts and experts are working together to find ways to reduce the damage typhoons cause and collect the massive amount of clean energy they generate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the project is only at the beginning, experts already consider many methods to achieve its goals. The first experiment they hope to conduct soon involves injecting large amounts of ice into the storm's eye to reduce its overall pressure and intensity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea is to deploy a fleet of remote-controlled ships into a storm that gathers and stores energy from wind and undersea turbines. In fact, according to their estimation, the energy of a single powerful typhoon could meet the global demand for energy for an entire month!</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, mainland Japan is relatively safe from super typhoons. However, the country already suffers from "regular" typhoons, and climate change is likely to send more powerful ones in the years to come. Also, Japan's access to energy sources is limited, and many worry about the country's zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harnessing a super typhoon's energy seems like a highly challenging task. However, success in such a game-changing endeavour would completely change how we see typhoons. Indeed, they would become a blessing rather than a threat.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish startup </span><a href="https://www.sould.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produces eco-friendly building materials from eelgrass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of eelgrass as a building material dates back 400 years ago when Danish folks were using this highly available sea plant as a roofing material. After ten years of research and development, Søuld adapted that traditional building technique into a modern process that leverages the eelgrass’ CO2-binding properties to create furniture that also serves as a carbon sink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, this highly fashionable, recyclable and non-toxic furniture creates a healthier indoor environment. Indeed, it dampens noise and provides acoustic comfort, and absorbs and releases moisture without rotting to create a healthy indoor climate free from bacteria, mould and other microbes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, these products offer thermal insulation, resistance to fire and can last more than 150 years, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated that indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, leading to asthma, decreased lung function and heart issues. And, with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, indoor air quality is even more crucial.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on our location, the weather can generate humid conditions, breeding mould in our home. In this context, investing in a dehumidifier can go a long way to creating a healthier environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our homes usually feature many filters that help us eliminate pollutants, dust and allergens. However, we should make sure to change the filter of our vacuum cleaner, clothes dryer, kitchen vent and AC regularly to ensure their proper functioning – especially if we live in a metropolitan area with high pollution levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we can leverage nature and install a few indoor plants to clean our environment while improving our mood and enhancing our home décor. Small plants like ferns and lilies and larger palm trees are the best options to pull contaminants out of the air. However, be careful about potential allergies before your next trip to your local florist!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld’s approach respects the cultural heritage of eelgrass while meeting the design and environmental needs of today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, a diamond is a piece of carbon crushed to a point where its atoms form a specific structure. Traditionally, jewellers let Nature do this part and extract diamonds directly from the Earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aether flipped the script and developed a process to create diamonds from air pollution, effectively removing carbon from the air for each carat they produce. Moreover, the company achieved an overall carbon-negative footprint by using only renewable and low-emission sources throughout the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, a two-carat ring will offset roughly 40 metric tonnes of carbon emissions, corresponding to two and a half years of a typical American person’s emissions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted by movies like “Blood Diamond,” traditional diamond production enables human exploitation, conflicts and environmental devastation. In terms of global warming alone, the diamond trade is responsible for at least 12 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its game-changing technology, Aether offers a conflict-free and eco-friendly alternative that features the same physical, chemical and optical characteristics as ‘traditional’ diamonds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of eelgrass as a building material dates back 400 years ago when Danish folks were using this highly available sea plant as a roofing material. After ten years of research and development, Søuld adapted that traditional building technique into a modern process that leverages the eelgrass’ CO2-binding properties to create furniture that also serves as a carbon sink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, this highly fashionable, recyclable and non-toxic furniture creates a healthier indoor environment. Indeed, it dampens noise and provides acoustic comfort, and absorbs and releases moisture without rotting to create a healthy indoor climate free from bacteria, mould and other microbes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, these products offer thermal insulation, resistance to fire and can last more than 150 years, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated that indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, leading to asthma, decreased lung function and heart issues. And, with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, indoor air quality is even more crucial.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on our location, the weather can generate humid conditions, breeding mould in our home. In this context, investing in a dehumidifier can go a long way to creating a healthier environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our homes usually feature many filters that help us eliminate pollutants, dust and allergens. However, we should make sure to change the filter of our vacuum cleaner, clothes dryer, kitchen vent and AC regularly to ensure their proper functioning – especially if we live in a metropolitan area with high pollution levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we can leverage nature and install a few indoor plants to clean our environment while improving our mood and enhancing our home décor. Small plants like ferns and lilies and larger palm trees are the best options to pull contaminants out of the air. However, be careful about potential allergies before your next trip to your local florist!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld’s approach respects the cultural heritage of eelgrass while meeting the design and environmental needs of today.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/japan-wants-to-harness-the-energy-of-super-typhoons-to-reach-climate-goals.html">The Guild’s Pick</a></span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/typhoon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese "Typoonshot" project aims to mitigate typhoon-related risks and harness their energy to help the country reach zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the brand new Typhoon Science and Technology Research Center at </span><a href="https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/" target="null"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yokohama National University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers, analysts and experts are working together to find ways to reduce the damage typhoons cause and collect the massive amount of clean energy they generate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the project is only at the beginning, experts already consider many methods to achieve its goals. The first experiment they hope to conduct soon involves injecting large amounts of ice into the storm's eye to reduce its overall pressure and intensity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea is to deploy a fleet of remote-controlled ships into a storm that gathers and stores energy from wind and undersea turbines. In fact, according to their estimation, the energy of a single powerful typhoon could meet the global demand for energy for an entire month!</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, mainland Japan is relatively safe from super typhoons. However, the country already suffers from "regular" typhoons, and climate change is likely to send more powerful ones in the years to come. Also, Japan's access to energy sources is limited, and many worry about the country's zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harnessing a super typhoon's energy seems like a highly challenging task. However, success in such a game-changing endeavour would completely change how we see typhoons. Indeed, they would become a blessing rather than a threat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎵 The Egyptian duo </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/Elboumaband/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ElBouma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creates music that gives voice to the girls and women in rural areas of Egypt. The two sisters Marina and Mariam Samir organized workshops to gather testimonies that fueled their lyrics against sexism, patriarchy, gender-based violence, and other harmful practices that exist in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">💰 Oxford University researchers and Global Accelerate Ventures (GAV) joined forces to create </span><a href="https://oxgav.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OXGAV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world’s first conservation venture fund. The fund identified 6 “trillion-dollar problems” it wants to solve by giving solution-focused technology companies greater access to private sector investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🦟 In Sweden, the startup </span><a href="https://www.molecular-attraction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Molecular Attraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discovered that it’s possible to use a specific molecule to trick mosquitoes into consuming virtually anything - including toxins that kill them. Since this molecule only attracts mosquitoes, it can prevent spraying pesticides over large areas, eliminating the associated health and environmental risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🚀 The Swiss company ABB launched the </span><a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/09/30/full-battery-in-15-minutes-this-is-the-world-s-fastest-electric-car-charger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world’s fastest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electric car charger. According to the company, the new Terra 360 modular charger can charge up to four vehicles at once, charge any electric car within 15 minutes and deliver 100km of range in less than 3 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌳 Scientists from ETH Zurich’s </span><a href="https://www.crowtherlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowther Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded the </span><a href="https://www.restor.eco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, an interactive map that indicates the evolution of tree coverage for any arbitrary land area, the amount of carbon currently sequestrated in the soil, and how much more it could store after a restoration effort.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann jointly won the 2021 Nobel prize in physics. These two climate modellers laid the foundations of our current understanding of carbon dioxide’s impact on the climate since the 1960s and 1980s respectively.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Health Organization greenlighted the </span><a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malaria vaccine RTS,S</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for use across Africa. This vaccine was proven effective six years ago and recently underwent a successful pilot immunization programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03737-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that the Montreal Protocol, which was only supposed to fight against ozone-depleting chemicals, has prevented between 0.65°C and 1°C of global warming. Indeed, carbon sequestration in vegetation through photosynthesis would have dropped by 30% without the treaty.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine and Oregon made the companies that create consumer packaging</span><a href="https://www.theplanetarypress.com/2021/09/packaging-generates-a-lot-of-waste-now-maine-and-oregon-want-manufacturers-to-foot-the-bill-for-getting-rid-of-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responsible for the recycling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and disposal of their products (e.g., cardboard cartons, plastic wrap and food containers).</span></li>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based organization </span><a href="https://www.ecologicstudio.com/projects/airbubble-playground-and-exhibition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed a children's play centre called AirBubble that uses algae in solar-powered bioreactors to remove pollutants from the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar energy powers photosynthesis by which algae split carbon dioxide into carbon, which it uses to feed, and oxygen, which it releases into the room. On the other hand, the children's play activates machinery that moves liquid through the bioreactors, ensuring proper aeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the designer, the system can filter up to 200 litres of air per minute and purify the entire structure in less than 24h, driving pollution levels down to within World Health Organization guidelines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this process transforms pollutants into biomass, a raw material for bioplastics, food supplements, natural cosmetics and more. So, we ultimately end up with usable byproducts instead of waste.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio chose to install AirBubble in Warsaw, Poland, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, to educate people about air quality in a playful way. Indeed, the link between urban air quality, respiratory health and public well-being has become more evident during Covid, and tackling this issue is crucial for our future. Also, the organization wants to inspire future generations to find innovative solutions for our current problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can we do? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In urban areas, most of our trips are less than a few kilometres long. Using public transportation, biking or walking for these trips can go a long way to reducing pollution. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using an electric vehicle is also highly effective. Indeed, thermic cars are particularly suboptimal for short travels involving many stops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, studies showed that planting </span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/can-tiny-forests-breathe-fresh-air-into-our-cities/a-57608913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny forests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cities can improve biodiversity, air quality and even our well-being. As citizens of these cities, we can vote and advocate to move these initiatives forward.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoever spends time with kids realizes that they are an inextinguishable source of energy. This fantastic project leverages this energy to provide our children with a pure atmosphere and educate them on the importance of air quality.</span></p>

<p>While working at a charity shop, the creator, Charlotte Liebling, witnessed the massive amount of toys thrown away. Her social enterprise wants to encourage people to buy pre-owned soft toys and change their perceptions regarding second-hand items. Indeed, she asks previous owners to provide toys’ back story to add a sentimental value that brand new toys don’t possess.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company's meteoric success <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> from 20 new toys per week last year to 1,000 today <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> proves that people are ready to change how they consume.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plush toy market is valued at around $10 billion and grows 7% each year. However, their production requires a large amount of water and energy, and most of the time, they include petrol-based polyester. Moreover, a </span><a href="https://www.charityretail.org.uk/british-heart-foundation-calls-on-parents-to-donate-unwanted-toys-this-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that 50% of children are tired of a new toy after only a week and 25% of parents throw away perfectly good items that end up in a landfill.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can we do? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can donate our unused toys to charity, schools or social enterprises like Loved Before instead of throwing them away. This simple action will not only benefit the environment but also bring joy to other people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies, such as LEGO or Mattel, also have toy recycling schemes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, many cities worldwide feature toy hospitals that can repair and clean the toys we want to keep and pass on to the next generation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Internet is full of DIY videos and posts that explain how to use old toys to build new furniture and decorative objects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between a toy and its owner goes beyond the utilitarian aspect. Charlotte’s wholesome initiative enables perpetuating our memories while reducing the environmental footprint of the toy industry.</span></p>

So, he developed a game in cooperation with the software company </span><a href="https://appliedvr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied VR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and uses it with his young patients when they undergo medical procedures, such as IV preparation or bandages replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explains that pain highly depends on the context. Indeed, pain is more acute when we are stressed out or overly focused on it. But, on the other hand, our body produces natural endorphins, which are a neurochemical analgesic, when we’re having fun.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/43/3/266/4558507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrate that VR <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> especially interactive games <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> is significantly more effective than any other distraction for pain management. Indeed, our brain is unable to tell the difference between a virtual and a real environment.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR can have a broad range of usages, from purely managing pain to eliminating anxiety or simply distracting a kid to make them stay still. Whatever the use case, it always reduces the need for drugs and prevents the associated side effects (e.g. adverse reaction, addiction). Also, using VR before surgeries can lead to shorter recovery times and better overall postoperative outcomes. Otherwise, nurses and doctors are more relaxed and are in better dispositions to do a great job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a refreshing change of pace to see video games and technology being praised for their health benefits, especially when it means reducing the need for pain medication and sedation.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann jointly won the 2021 Nobel prize in physics. These two climate modellers laid the foundations of our current understanding of carbon dioxide’s impact on the climate since the 1960s and 1980s respectively.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Health Organization greenlighted the </span><a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malaria vaccine RTS,S</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for use across Africa. This vaccine was proven effective six years ago and recently underwent a successful pilot immunization programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03737-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that the Montreal Protocol, which was only supposed to fight against ozone-depleting chemicals, has prevented between 0.65°C and 1°C of global warming. Indeed, carbon sequestration in vegetation through photosynthesis would have dropped by 30% without the treaty.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine and Oregon made the companies that create consumer packaging</span><a href="https://www.theplanetarypress.com/2021/09/packaging-generates-a-lot-of-waste-now-maine-and-oregon-want-manufacturers-to-foot-the-bill-for-getting-rid-of-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responsible for the recycling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and disposal of their products (e.g., cardboard cartons, plastic wrap and food containers).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia returned some of its world-famous national parks to </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043256101/indigenous-australians-get-land-back-queensland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the hands of Indigenous owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last month, the Eastern Kuku Yalanji community and the government signed a deal for an area that includes the Daintree National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and three other national parks.</span></li>

<h2 id="toys"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐻 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/an-adoption-agency-for-preloved-toys-opens-in-london.html">The Adoption Agency for Preloved Teddy Bears</a></span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/teddy-bear-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1439" height="810"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, </span><a href="https://www.lovedbefore.london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loved Before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened a “soft toy adoption agency” to promote sustainability in the industry and give preloved toys a second life.</span></p>
<p>While working at a charity shop, the creator, Charlotte Liebling, witnessed the massive amount of toys thrown away. Her social enterprise wants to encourage people to buy pre-owned soft toys and change their perceptions regarding second-hand items. Indeed, she asks previous owners to provide toys’ back story to add a sentimental value that brand new toys don’t possess.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meteoric success of this company <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> from 20 new toys per week last year to 1,000 today <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> proves that people are now ready to change how they consume.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plush toy market is valued at around $10 billion and grows 7% each year. However, their production requires a large amount of water and energy, and most of the time, they include petrol-based polyester. Moreover, a </span><a href="https://www.charityretail.org.uk/british-heart-foundation-calls-on-parents-to-donate-unwanted-toys-this-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that 50% of children are tired of a new toy after only a week and 25% of parents throw away perfectly good items that end up in a landfill.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can we do? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can donate our unused toys to charity, schools or social enterprises like Loved Before instead of throwing them away. This simple action will not only benefit the environment but also bring joy to other people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies, such as LEGO or Mattel, also have toy recycling schemes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, many cities worldwide feature toy hospitals that can repair and clean the toys we want to keep and pass on to the next generation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Internet is full of DIY videos and posts that explain how to use old toys to build new furniture and decorative objects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between a toy and its owner goes beyond the utilitarian aspect. Charlotte’s wholesome initiative enables perpetuating our memories while reducing the environmental footprint of the toy industry.</span></p>
<h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/childrens-play-centre-uses-algae-to-clean-the-air.html">The Guild’s Pick</a></span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/algae.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="851" height="479"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based organization </span><a href="https://www.ecologicstudio.com/projects/airbubble-playground-and-exhibition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed a children's play centre called AirBubble that uses algae in solar-powered bioreactors to remove pollutants from the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar energy powers photosynthesis by which algae split carbon dioxide into carbon, which it uses to feed, and oxygen, which it releases into the room. On the other hand, the children's play activates machinery that moves liquid through the bioreactors, ensuring proper aeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the designer, the system can filter up to 200 litres of air per minute and purify the entire structure in less than 24h, driving pollution levels down to within World Health Organization guidelines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this process transforms pollutants into biomass, a raw material for bioplastics, food supplements, natural cosmetics and more. So, we ultimately end up with usable byproducts instead of waste.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio chose to install AirBubble in Warsaw, Poland, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, to educate people about air quality in a playful way. Indeed, the link between urban air quality, respiratory health and public well-being has become more evident during Covid, and tackling this issue is crucial for our future. Also, the organization wants to inspire future generations to find innovative solutions for our current problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can we do? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In urban areas, most of our trips are less than a few kilometres long. Using public transportation, biking or walking for these trips can go a long way to reducing pollution. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using an electric vehicle is also highly effective. Indeed, thermic cars are particularly suboptimal for short travels involving many stops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, studies showed that planting </span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/can-tiny-forests-breathe-fresh-air-into-our-cities/a-57608913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny forests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cities can improve biodiversity, air quality and even our well-being. As citizens of these cities, we can vote and advocate to move these initiatives forward.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoever spends time with kids realizes that they are an inextinguishable source of energy. This fantastic project leverages this energy to provide our children with a pure atmosphere and educate them on the importance of air quality.</span></p>

<h2 id="worldwide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide …</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🚀 Researchers from The University of Texas have found a low-cost and efficient way to split off oxygen molecules </span><a href="https://cockrell.utexas.edu/news/archive/9300-making-clean-hydrogen-is-hard-but-researchers-just-solved-a-major-hurdle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from water using sunlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This discovery solves a significant hurdle to sustainably producing hydrogen from water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">📌 Google Maps will show the </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90683605/google-maps-can-now-show-you-the-most-fuel-efficient-route" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most fuel-efficient route</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside the fastest one and the amount of fuel you can save with a slight detour. This new release also indicates flights’ CO2 emissions, sustainability information about hotels and businesses, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♻ In Denmark, the </span><a href="https://www.re-wind.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-Wind Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores ways to reuse old wind blades in architectural and engineering structures, such as protective bike shelters or pedestrian bridges. Indeed, it wasn’t possible to recycle these blades until recently. Therefore, most of them ended up in the landfill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🚄 The French National Railway Company (SNCF) </span><a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/10/01/after-40-years-in-a-graveyard-these-french-trains-are-coming-back-to-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kickstarted an initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to recycle the 5,000 unused rail cars collecting dust and rust throughout the country. The company pledged to find a new purpose for all of those trains by 2028.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌊 Scientists in the US designed a system that can filter out microplastics from water without ever clogging. This mechanism mimics how </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-environment-58573451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manta rays filter out plankton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using a complex pattern of whirlpools that moves the microplastics away from the filter.</span></p>
