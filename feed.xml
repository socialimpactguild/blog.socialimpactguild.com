                <p>Scientists and engineers at The University of Texas at Austin have created a hydrogel tablet to <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2021/10/05/this-hydrogel-tablet-can-purify-a-liter-of-river-water-in-an-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purify contaminated water</a> rapidly.</p>
<p>One tablet can clean a litre of water and make it drinkable in less than an hour. The hydrogel generates hydrogen peroxide to neutralize more than 99.999% of bacteria by attacking their essential cell components and disrupting their metabolism.</p>
<p>Moreover, the researchers say that scaling production would be straightforward. Indeed, materials are cheap, and the synthesis process is simple, even at scale. Also, they can control the tablets’ shape and size to adapt them to different use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Almost a third of the world does not have clean drinking water, and half of the population could experience extreme water scarcity by 2025. The existing purification processes rely on boiling water, which requires a lot of energy and time, and is not practical for the people who lack clean water the most.</p>
<p>Finding a solution to the water crisis could save millions of people. In this context, these hydrogel tablets can make a massive difference as they are easy to use, highly efficient and scalable to mass production.</p>

                <p>In London, the <a href="https://spring.co.uk/trade-inn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade-Inn pub</a> lets you pay for your food and beverages with electronic waste.</p>
<p>This pub accepts almost 14,000 electronic devices—including old iPhones—that they repair and resell afterwards or recycle if too damaged.</p>
<p>​<a href="https://spring.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring</a>, the company behind this project, is a new tech recirculation service that opens pods throughout England where people can drop their old tech in exchange for actual money.</p>
<p>So far, Spring has resold or recycled around 13,000 devices, saving almost 1,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions and diverting more than 2 tonnes of e-waste from landfills. Moreover, the company is currently working on opening a shop that sells refurbished items only.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Each year, the UK produces 1.6 million tonnes of electronic waste and is forecast to be Europe’s biggest producer by 2024. Today, much of this waste ends up in a landfill or incinerated, affecting the environment considerably.</p>
<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An average adult owns around 20 unused electronic devices. Putting them back in circulation would reduce the demand for new devices and the related environmental impact. Also, sorting and reselling our old tech can be highly beneficial for our bank account.</li>
<li>Although our old laptop might no longer be enough for us, many schools, libraries, or charities might give it a new purpose. The best way to donate a computer is to reach out to a third-party organization, such as <a href="https://spring.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digitunity</a> or the <a href="https://spring.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Computer Exchange</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) lets us reduce our reliance on hard drives and USB sticks to store our data, limiting the amount of e-waste we generate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the genius marketing stunt, the Trade-Inn pub raises awareness about electronic waste and provides an easy way to give our old devices a new life.</p>

                <p><a href="https://droneseed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DroneSeed</a> developed a drone-based technology to reforest lands after wildfires efficiently.</p>
<p>The drones pack everything new trees need to thrive: seeds, nutrients, and natural pest deterrent. Also, the company uses laser mapping technology to determine where the seeds have the highest chance of survival to optimize the process.</p>
<p>DroneSeed can reforest up to 50 acres per day with five drones and four employees. In contrast, traditional reforestation methods that plant nursery-grown trees by hand can only cover 2 acres per day and cost up to 50% more.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> The severity and frequency of recent wildfires threaten Nature’s capacity to reforest. Without intervention, most of these forests could disappear in the following decades, with dramatic repercussions on biodiversity, air quality and global warming.</p>
<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to prevent fire from spreading is never to leave a campfire or fire pit unattended. Also, we should make sure to extinguish it completely before leaving.</li>
<li>Under certain conditions, even a small campfire can turn into a significant fire. Therefore, it’s preferable to alert the authorities immediately whenever we spot an unattended fire — even a small one.</li>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese "Typoonshot" project aims to mitigate typhoon-related risks and harness their energy to help the country reach zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the brand new Typhoon Science and Technology Research Center at </span><a href="https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/" target="null"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yokohama National University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers, analysts and experts are working together to find ways to reduce the damage typhoons cause and collect the massive amount of clean energy they generate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the project is only at the beginning, experts already consider many methods to achieve its goals. The first experiment they hope to conduct soon involves injecting large amounts of ice into the storm's eye to reduce its overall pressure and intensity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea is to deploy a fleet of remote-controlled ships into a storm that gathers and stores energy from wind and undersea turbines. In fact, according to their estimation, the energy of a single powerful typhoon could meet the global demand for energy for an entire month!</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, mainland Japan is relatively safe from super typhoons. However, the country already suffers from "regular" typhoons, and climate change is likely to send more powerful ones in the years to come. Also, Japan's access to energy sources is limited, and many worry about the country's zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harnessing a super typhoon's energy seems like a highly challenging task. However, success in such a game-changing endeavour would completely change how we see typhoons. Indeed, they would become a blessing rather than a threat.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish startup </span><a href="https://www.sould.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produces eco-friendly building materials from eelgrass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of eelgrass as a building material dates back 400 years ago when Danish folks were using this highly available sea plant as a roofing material. After ten years of research and development, Søuld adapted that traditional building technique into a modern process that leverages the eelgrass’ CO2-binding properties to create furniture that also serves as a carbon sink.</span></p>
<p>Also, this highly fashionable, recyclable and non-toxic furniture creates a healthier indoor environment. Indeed, it dampens noise, provides acoustic comfort, and absorbs and releases moisture without rotting, resulting in a healthy indoor climate free from noise, bacteria, mould, and other microbes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, these products also offer thermal insulation and resistance to fire and can last more than 150 years, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated that indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, leading to asthma, decreased lung function and heart issues. And, with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, indoor air quality is even more crucial.</span></p>
<p><strong>What else can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on our location, the weather can generate humid conditions, breeding mould in our home. In this context, investing in a dehumidifier can go a long way to creating a healthier environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our homes usually feature many filters that help us eliminate pollutants, dust and allergens. However, we should make sure to change the filter of our vacuum cleaner, clothes dryer, kitchen vent and AC regularly to ensure their proper functioning – especially if we live in a metropolitan area with high pollution levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we can leverage nature and install a few indoor plants to clean our environment while improving our mood and enhancing our home décor. Small plants like ferns and lilies and larger palm trees are the best options to pull contaminants out of the air. However, be careful about potential allergies before your next trip to your local florist!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld’s approach respects the cultural heritage of eelgrass while meeting the design and environmental needs of today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, a diamond is a piece of carbon crushed to a point where its atoms form a specific structure. Traditionally, jewellers let Nature do this part and extract diamonds directly from the Earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aether flipped the script and developed a process to create diamonds from air pollution, effectively removing carbon from the air for each carat they produce. Moreover, the company achieved an overall carbon-negative footprint by using only renewable and low-emission sources throughout the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, a two-carat ring will offset roughly 40 metric tonnes of carbon emissions, corresponding to two and a half years of a typical American person’s emissions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted by movies like “Blood Diamond,” traditional diamond production enables human exploitation, conflicts and environmental devastation. In terms of global warming alone, the diamond trade is responsible for at least 12 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its game-changing technology, Aether offers a conflict-free and eco-friendly alternative that features the same physical, chemical and optical characteristics as ‘traditional’ diamonds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of research, </span><a href="https://aetherdiamonds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aether diamonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cracked the technology allowing them to create the world’s first carbon-negative diamonds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, a diamond is a piece of carbon crushed to a point where its atoms form a specific structure. Traditionally, jewellers let Nature do this part and extract diamonds directly from the Earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aether flipped the script and developed a process to create diamonds from air pollution, effectively removing carbon from the air for each carat they produce. Moreover, the company achieved an overall carbon-negative footprint by using only renewable and low-emission sources throughout the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, a two-carat ring will offset roughly 40 metric tonnes of carbon emissions, corresponding to two and a half years of a typical American person’s emissions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted by movies like “Blood Diamond,” traditional diamond production enables human exploitation, conflicts and environmental devastation. In terms of global warming alone, the diamond trade is responsible for at least 12 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its game-changing technology, Aether offers a conflict-free and eco-friendly alternative that features the same physical, chemical and optical characteristics as ‘traditional’ diamonds.</span></p>

<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/eelgrass.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/eelgrass-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/eelgrass-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/eelgrass-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="798" height="449"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish startup </span><a href="https://www.sould.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produces eco-friendly building materials from eelgrass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of eelgrass as a building material dates back 400 years ago when Danish folks were using this highly available sea plant as a roofing material. After ten years of research and development, Søuld adapted that traditional building technique into a modern process that leverages the eelgrass’ CO2-binding properties to create furniture that also serves as a carbon sink.</span></p>
<p>Also, this highly fashionable, recyclable and non-toxic furniture creates a healthier indoor environment. Indeed, it dampens noise, provides acoustic comfort, and absorbs and releases moisture without rotting, resulting in a healthy indoor climate free from noise, bacteria, mould, and other microbes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, these products also offer thermal insulation and resistance to fire and can last more than 150 years, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated that indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, leading to asthma, decreased lung function and heart issues. And, with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, indoor air quality is even more crucial.</span></p>
<p><strong>What else can we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on our location, the weather can generate humid conditions, breeding mould in our home. In this context, investing in a dehumidifier can go a long way to creating a healthier environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our homes usually feature many filters that help us eliminate pollutants, dust and allergens. However, we should make sure to change the filter of our vacuum cleaner, clothes dryer, kitchen vent and AC regularly to ensure their proper functioning – especially if we live in a metropolitan area with high pollution levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we can leverage nature and install a few indoor plants to clean our environment while improving our mood and enhancing our home décor. Small plants like ferns and lilies and larger palm trees are the best options to pull contaminants out of the air. However, be careful about potential allergies before your next trip to your local florist!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Søuld’s approach respects the cultural heritage of eelgrass while meeting the design and environmental needs of today.</span></p>

<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/typhoon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese "Typoonshot" project aims to mitigate typhoon-related risks and harness their energy to help the country reach zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the brand new Typhoon Science and Technology Research Center at </span><a href="https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/" target="null"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yokohama National University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers, analysts and experts are working together to find ways to reduce the damage typhoons cause and collect the massive amount of clean energy they generate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the project is only at the beginning, experts already consider many methods to achieve its goals. The first experiment they hope to conduct soon involves injecting large amounts of ice into the storm's eye to reduce its overall pressure and intensity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea is to deploy a fleet of remote-controlled ships into a storm that gathers and stores energy from wind and undersea turbines. In fact, according to their estimation, the energy of a single powerful typhoon could meet the global demand for energy for an entire month!</span></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, mainland Japan is relatively safe from super typhoons. However, the country already suffers from "regular" typhoons, and climate change is likely to send more powerful ones in the years to come. Also, Japan's access to energy sources is limited, and many worry about the country's zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harnessing a super typhoon's energy seems like a highly challenging task. However, success in such a game-changing endeavour would completely change how we see typhoons. Indeed, they would become a blessing rather than a threat.</span></p>
