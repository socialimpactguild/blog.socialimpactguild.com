Specifically, her team <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90655823/mussels-can-be-a-natural-filter-to-remove-microplastic-from-the-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uses mussels</a> to filter water and extract tiny pieces of plastic – smaller than 5 millimetres across – generated from plastic pollution disintegration.<p></p><p>As it feeds, an adult mussel can filter up to 55 litres of water a day. During their experiments, Pennie’s team placed 300 mussels in a tank and found that they filtered out more than 250,000 microplastics per hour! The mussels eventually excrete the microplastics, which naturally sink into the water and become readily disposable. All this happens without causing any harm to the mussels.</p><p>In the future, Pennie also hopes to use the plastic-filled excrements as a biofuel since they are rich in carbon.</p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Collecting microplastic is difficult. Projects like the <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/turning-face-masks-into-trees-and-cleaning-up-the-ocean#cleanup-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ocean Cleanup</a> can gather large pieces of plastic, but no organization has yet managed to extract smaller particles at scale. By leveraging nature’s potential, this project could uncover a way to tackle microplastic pollution naturally 😎</p><p>(source: fastcompany.com)</p><h2>🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</h2><p>🏊‍ The residents of New York City might soon be able to swim in the famously polluted Hudson River. To achieve this feat, the non-profit organization <a href="https://pluspool.org/pool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">+ POOL</a> designed a plus-shaped, water-filtering, floating swimming pool. Once deployed, this 9,000 square foot pool will filter 600,000 gallons per day -- cleaning the river bit by bit while letting New Yorkers enjoy a new recreational space.</p><p>🚲 In Finland, you can now go to your library to borrow books and <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/finnish-library-loans-out-e-cargo-bikes-for-free-5191645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e-cargo bikes</a>!

The company partnered with LanzaTech, a biotech startup that turns pollution into ethanol and uses it as feedstock to produce polyester. The resulting fabric is completely identical to regular polyester and could pave the way to a future without fossil-carbon-based clothes.</p><p>👟 Honda, the Japanese car company, designed an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/6/honda-navigation-system-in-shoe-gps-visually-impaired-people-wearable-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-shoe navigation system</a> for people with vision loss. The system includes a three-dimensional vibration device and a motion sensor attached inside the shoe. The associated app can guide the person by making their foot vibrate in the required direction. This mechanism is insensitive to ambient noises and leaves users free to use their hands.</p><p>🎵 When the musician Yoko Sen had to spend time in a hospital, she noticed that the surrounding sound affected her ability to recuperate. So as soon as she recovered, she created <a href="http://www.sensound.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SenSound</a> to humanize hospital sounds. Almost 80% of sounds in the ER come from patient monitoring, and making them more soothing can go a long way towards improving patients’ journey and recovery.</p><h2>​😍 Wholesomeness</h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/32/dog-2.jfif" alt="" width="633" height="998"></figure><hr><p>That’s a wrap.
