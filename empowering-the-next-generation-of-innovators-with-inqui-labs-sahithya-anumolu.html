I'm from India, a state called Telangana and city, Hyderabad. I have been in education since 2014, starting with a <a href="https://www.teachforindia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teach for India</a> fellowship <span class="nounderlines">â€“ which </span>was my first 101 into education and public schools. Right after, we co-founded Inqui-Lab Foundation in 2017 with two of my colleagues from Teach for India: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshwarbt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eshwar Bandi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-piddempally-b2242143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivek Piddempally</a>.</p><p>For the last three years, we have been running this organisation. Our vision is to nurture problem-solving skills in children. I am very excited about this conversation and looking forward to share more about what we do!<br><br><strong>Where do the students come from? Do you have partnerships with schools? Or, can any student reach out to your organisation?</strong></p><p>As an organisation, we have decided that we want to work with public school students from socially economically disadvantaged communities. So, with that mission in mind, we basically work a lot with the public school system. For all the interventions that we design, we also keep in mind that we want to scale them through this system.</p><blockquote><p>We were witnessing students observing problems, coming up with creative ideas, and excited to test these ideas.</p></blockquote><p><strong>How do you foster student innovation?</strong><br><br>Our organisation was started by us witnessing the kind of ideas that students were coming up with in our classrooms! For example, a student had said <em>'my mother wakes up many times in the night because she has to rock my sister's cradle, and I want to make a cradle that automatically rocks as soon as my sister cries'</em>. So, we were witnessing students observing problems, coming up with creative ideas, and were excited to test these ideas.</p><p>From that starting point where we saw potential, we then started looking at how best we can equip students to innovate. That is where we segwayed into the design thinking process, for example. We thought about how we can teach design thinking to children between the age group of 10 to 15. How can we simplify the process for them? And, how can we teach it at scale in schools? So, we started researching and designing around these questions.<br><br><strong>Can you tell me more about how you use design thinking?</strong><br><br>We see it as a process for problem solving and have crafted our own four-step process to use it: finding and understanding a problem, ideate to solve it, make and test (step where you iterate on your ideas), and present. The last point consists of sharing your ideas with a larger group. This four-step process is inspired by what we learned through our research on design thinking as well as local and global education for children, including at Stanford.Â <br><br>Design thinking is meant to be user driven. So, you get feedback from users and iterate on your ideas. Keeping that in mind, we try to ensure that, within our program, students are not just thinking about building an end product, but the process and takeaways that they get through it are equally important.</p><blockquote><p>The School Innovation Challenge was done in partnership with UNICEF [...]. We went from working with 3,000 students to 23,000 students by establishing multiple partnerships.</p></blockquote><p><strong>You mentioned that prototyping is an integral part of your four-step process. So, many of your students's ideas come to life through a prototype. Do you produce these prototypes at scale?</strong><br><br>For us, scaling is at a program level. We have two flagship programs that we run for students.</p><p>One is called <a href="https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/copy-of-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Think &amp; Make</a>. It is an in-school program, a weekly intervention, meant for grades 8th and 9th. Through the two years, students do multiple units of innovation. In every unit, they come up with an idea and a prototype. What we scale right now is the intervention itself. For instance, we are currently reaching two schools, how could we make take it to 5, 10, 25, 200, 5000 schools throughout the state? For the prototypes themselves, we are looking at multiple opportunities right now. They are currently making them in the classrooms and presenting them to their peers during the programs. However, we are exploring whether a great student idea can get further opportunities. Can it be implemented, mentored, funded?Â <br><br>The second program is called <a href="https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/copy-2-of-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School Innovation Challenge</a>. We are running it as a result of COVID-19. It consists of online and in-school interventions where we codify a three-hour problem-solving course. During this course, students learn the basics of design thinking and problem solving. Then, they do a capstone project that they submit to us. This School Innovation Challenge was done in partnership with UNICEF, and brought a lot of learnings for us. For example, we went from working with 3,000 students to 23,000 students by establishing multiple partnerships. So, we understood what scaling means. This was definitely a highlight for us!<br><br><strong>Congratulations! Can you tell me more about these partnerships?</strong><br><br>I cannot imagine Inqui-Lab or any of our work without partnerships. For our School Innovation Challenge program, we had four main ones.</p><p>We worked in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.teamtsic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telangana State Innovation Cell</a> since the beginning, a center in our state whose mission is to encourage innovation at the school, college and corporate levels.</p><p>UNICEF trusted us with the program design, and also funded its development. We also partnered with the Telangana State Education Department of our state, who were willing to roll this out to 5,000 schools during the COVID time. We trained around 5,000 teachers, which then helped us take this program to the 23,000 students. Â </p><p>The fourth partnership I would like to highlight is with makers. The top 25 ideas received mentorship and prototyping support from individuals working in NGOs who came forward and helped us. So, there is a lot of volunteering as well, which is a significant partnership component that we would like to explore. So, we had partnerships at every step of the program: funding, program design, implementation, etc.</p><blockquote><p>We started to develop our own kit, which has electronics, hand tools, [...] and other materials. This is the part that kids are so excited about. They are always looking for the prototyping session.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Where do you source the materials and tools necessary for the prototyping?</strong><br><br>In terms of materials, we are exploring two ways. For some of our programs, we did have a partnership with another for-profit company that also builds kits. They have electronics that they donated to us.</p><p>However, we had also started to develop our own kit, which has electronics, hand tools, small drill bits, small saws, wood and other materials that they can use in their prototypes. Actually, this is the part that kids are so excited about. They are always looking for the prototyping session.</p><p>The main reason we started in-house design is because of the cost factor. No partnership could offer us the cost that we were aiming for the kit. We do not have a manufacturing unit, right now it is very manualÂ and human-resource intensive. The largest kit number that we have manufactured is 300, but we will have to look at how we can ramp up our manufacturing process if we do want to scale up programs.<br><br><strong>Do you rely solely on donations or do you have other sources of revenues?</strong><br><br>From day one, we have been lucky enough to be able to diversify our fundraising. 85% of our operations depend on funding from donors, and 15% is raised through revenue via other activities, like workshops. Certain organisations were willing to pay us for the programs or kits that we delivered for their schools.</p><p>In terms of our sources, we have crowdfunding, companies' donations (i.e. CSR), grants, high-net-worth individuals donations, and incubators. Every year we have had either a grant or incubator to support us. Many incubators help organisations that are at an early stage (between zero to three years). So, they have been of significant help for us from day one, because they also provided us with mentorship. My two co-founders have both been instrumental in diversifying fundraising and ensuring that the organisation has the funds to continuously run from year to year.</p><blockquote><p>Today, we are a 15 to 20-member team [...]. We are learning the ropes around that, as the team is growing.</p></blockquote><p><strong>You are three partners. Do each of you has a specific role or everyone does a little bit of everything?</strong><br><br>It has changed year to year, but we definitely have a major role that each of us plays <span class="nounderlines">â€“</span>without having titles. For example, I focus on program design, curriculum design, etc. Vivek used to do a lot of the operations. Eshwar used to work on partnerships and fundraising. He speaks to a lot of people, brings in mentorship, and inputs from the external world.</p><p>So, each of us have strategically taken on certain roles, but we have also done everything <span class="nounderlines">â€“ </span>especially when we started off (e.g. fundraising, program design, impact measurement, etc). Today, we are a 15 to 20-member <a href="https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team</a>, and it has been an interesting journey for us. Indeed, it is not just the three of us now, so we need to have certain processes in place, a lot of project management, remote working â€“ which has been a new challenge for us this year. So, we are learning the ropes around that, as the team is growing.</p><blockquote><p>Many of our mentors say that at every stage, you are a different organisation, so if your staff gets bigger, you will face different challenges.Â </p></blockquote><p><strong>How do you get from the starting point, usually a group of people that want to accomplish something together, to making an impact as you are now?</strong>Â <br><br>I can definitely pinpoint two or three things. Many of our mentors say that at every stage, you are a different organisation, so if your staff gets bigger, you will face different challenges.Â <br><br>I can say that apart from your founding team, the immediate next people who join your team are extremely important. They need to be strong critical thinkers, who are willing to question our vision and pivot our thinking in many ways. Indeed, as co-founders, we can get stuck on certain viewpoints. We were extremely lucky to get the right team at the very beginning. Every single person acted like co-founders themselves. They were able to bring initiative, ownership, and design to the organisation.</p><p>Secondly, as the team was growing, we also started to take on more work. At this point, something that we have to get right is just resourcing across projects and saying no to certain things. We still struggle a bit in this area as we take on more than we can do, but we are trying to better estimate and ensure that the team is not taking on more than it can handle.</p><p>The third is just learning and development. We are a young team (between 20 to 30 years of age). Some people are joining us for their first year of employment. So, we have a lot of responsibility in terms of ensuring that they have the right role models and are getting the coaching they need â€“ which we are learning in the process.<br><br><strong>If you have to choose one thing â€“ if possible â€“ what would you say has been the most important point to pay attention for the foundation to blossom?</strong><br><br>I am going to keep the obvious finance fundraising aside, because that is important. So, I would say a shared vision across all the team members.</p><p>Even today, we spend time to ensure this, specially as we have three people leading. For example, we have to be clear about what student innovation means to each of us. When we are saying 'we want to nurture problem-solving skills', we need to know what problem-solving skills means to us. Or on a higher level, what does success mean for Inqui-Lab? Our common understanding of that is extremely important, and it applies to the rest of the team as well.</p><p>Being aligned on our vision, what we want to achieve and our goals is becoming more important to make sure everybody knows what is the most important thing to do when they get to the office everyday.</p><blockquote><p>When we hear stories like this, it is not just a success metric, but we see that students are beginning to believe that they can be partners in solving challenges around us.Â </p></blockquote><p><strong>What effects have you seen in the students life as a result of your initiatives?</strong></p><p>Students say that, when they see a problem, they now know that they are capable of thinking about an idea. I have also seen students implement their ideas. For example, Priyavarshini, as soon as COVID hit, she had to go back to her village as schools were closed. As soon as she arrived, she made awareness posters, masks with gunny bags, and distributed them in her community. When we hear stories like this, it is not just a success metric, but we see that students are beginning to believe that they can be partners in solving challenges around them.Â </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/Priyavarshini.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Priyavarshini-xs.png 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Priyavarshini-sm.png 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Priyavarshini-md.png 768w" alt="Priyavarshini" width="355" height="378"><figcaption>Priyavarshini is an inspiring student who made awareness posters and masks with gunny bags, and distributed them in her community.</figcaption></figure><p>Another example is Abhishek, whose idea was rated second best, among the 7000 ideas that we received in the School Innovation Challenge. He worked alongside Rajesh and Venu to conceive a low cost wearable, made with old fertiliser bags, to ease farmers' work. It was made and distributed to three families who helped test the idea. He told me that when he started interviewing people to understand the problems they were facing, he started to understand the world around him more. Also, he got to meet the high level dignitaries in our state, which is rare. Finally, he said that his parents, who were farmers, were felicitated at his school for his team's innovation.Â </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/Abhishek.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Abhishek-xs.png 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Abhishek-sm.png 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Abhishek-md.png 768w" alt="" width="750" height="425"><figcaption>Abhishek and his team's low cost wearable, made with old fertiliser bags, was rated second best in the School Innovation Challenge</figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, usually, the students who perform well academically are the ones who get highlighted, and everybody else is blurred out in the background, even from the teachers' perspective. In our specific classroom, we started to see that students who were providing the best ideas were not necessarily the ones who were getting the highest marks. So, we were starting to see these students also shine. They were getting recognised for their ideas and prototyping skills.</p><p>It is crucial for our programs to provide an inclusive and safe space for students. We also have a set of target skills and attitudes. When we talk about problem solving, it involves design thinking, team work, risk taking, innovative mindset <span class="nounderlines">â€“</span>Â which we measure during our programs as we consider them as impact.Â <br><br>To sum up, what brings me joy is when a student believes in their ability to solve problems and values their ideas. They are then able to get recognition from others, and people around start to see students as partners. As an organisation, we celebrate that as a big milestone.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the years to come and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong><br><br>We have been designing for a while now. So, we will focus on scaling now. We are looking at how best to have partnerships and funding to scale.<br><br>As an organisation, we are aiming for a peer led or student led model i.e. taught by the students themselves <span class="nounderlines">â€“</span> which is a highly scalable model. Also, we want the interventions to run without Inqui-Lab: let schools or communities run them. So, we think about how we could incentivise them to run them and what is the ecosystem to support that.<br><br>Ultimately, we want to create a large network of young individuals who care about SDGs, and are willing to do what it takes to build a better world.</p><p><strong>How can people help you and support your organisation?</strong><br><br>One is just collaboration with organisations for program design. The second is funding for student ideas, and schools that would like to run our programs.
