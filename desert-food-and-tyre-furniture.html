They make oils, flours, fruit powders, nuts, biscuits, sauce leaves, spices, jams and more.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sahel is home to many little-known native food trees that are well adapted to its climate. For instance, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boscia_senegalensis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hanza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a plant that contains more than 20% protein and has the same energy intake as rice. However, these food sources are often overlooked due to their deterrent look and colonial legacy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, most of this food needs processing to remove its bitter taste and make it attractive for locals and export. So, Sahara Sahel Food provides local communities with processing innovations and modern value chains to make this food production financially sustainable as part of </span><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/re-branding-misshapen-produce-and-planting-a-million-corals.html#pick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa’s Great Green Wall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project. The goal will then be to replicate, upscale and extend this model to new products and plants.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivating indigenous species leverages traditional agriculture methods and reduces irrigation costs. Moreover, it provides sustainable jobs for the local communities (mostly women) and increases food security while sequestrating carbon and fighting against desertification.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahara Sahel Foods’ model empowers locals to be part of the solution and reduces their reliance on imports or other external help.</span></p><h2 id="tyres"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🪑 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/nigerian-designer-upcycles-tyres-into-gorgeous-furniture.html">The Entrepreneur That Upcycles Tyres Into Furniture</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/41/tyre.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/41/responsive/tyre-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/41/responsive/tyre-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/41/responsive/tyre-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="749" height="422"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favour Oluma is a Nigerian entrepreneur who creates modern ottomans and coffee tables from old tyres through her company </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Retyredglam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retyredglam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing both of her parents, this self-taught designer decided to start her business to generate income for her family. She first experimented with old tyres she found in a refuse area by painting and decorating them. After posting some pictures on social media, Favour received an extremely positive response, which motivated her to kickstart her business.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of being an entrepreneur, Favour is also pursuing an education in soil science and land management at the </span><a href="https://futminna.edu.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal University of Technology, Minna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By doing so, she wants to fight gender prejudice and encourage other young girls to follow their dreams. Indeed, during her journey, many people tried to convince her to stop because “it was a man’s job.”</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria has one of the poorest populations in Africa.

In the rural state where Favour comes from, the poverty rate climbs to 75% of the population. Moreover, discarded tyres generate significant health issues by hosting insects and disease-transmitting pests. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favour found a way to overcome her challenges while benefitting her family and community, inspiring the younger generation and lessening pollution in Nigeria.
