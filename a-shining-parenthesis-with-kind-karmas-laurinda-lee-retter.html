We employ at-risk and homeless youth in Toronto to handcraft fine jewelry. We pay them hourly wages and, on top of that, we return proceeds back to support their individual goals such as funding, education, housing, courses, among others.</p><blockquote><p>It was a really hard time for me and I thought about how challenging it must be for youth who are in vulnerable situations as well.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What motivated you to help at-risk and homeless youth in particular?</strong></p><p>I think it was my own journey. I had worked for a long time and I actually went to school, for music. So, I have always wanted to be creative. I could not finish my university degree because I had mental health challenges during my third year. So, when I came back, I struggled to find work.</p><p>As I was recovering from mental illness, it was very challenging; I think the options were not really there. Some days, you just have a bad day, it is not that you do not want to be helpful or happy, but you have a bad day. So, looking back, I thought about how challenging it must be for youth who are in vulnerable situations. They grew up in environments where survival had to be their main focus, and they might not have the wherewithal to get a degree or go to university. So, I wanted to create employment options that addressed that, and helped them find purpose and success in a different way.<br><br><strong>I know that you set up programs to both further improve their lifestyle and reduce turnover. Can you tell me about these programs and their outcomes?</strong></p><p>We have a couple of different things in order for proceeds to get back at work. There is a point system where youth are rewarded for creating healthy lifestyles. On top of that, we also have a mentorship program as we have a lot of great customers in professional industries, always happy to volunteer their time, and they are often asking how they can be involved. So, if we have a youth who has a question about a specific industry that they can answer to, we connect them. It helps our youth get answers and support in areas that they need to get to where they want to go.</p><blockquote><p>We have youth who are already looking for ways to give back and support their community.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What changes have you noticed in their lives as a result of working with you? </strong></p><p>It has been incredible to see a variety of changes. A lot of them say that they have never been able to hold on a job as long as they have here. We have youth that say they would never want to leave because they just love it and it does not feel like work to them, which is so important. Also, when you are feeling unwell, your first instinct is to call in sick for everyone, but it has been amazing to see that our youth actually come to work and they leave saying, "I am glad I came in today because I actually feel better having been here!". That is such a great thing to hear!</p><p>Also, it has been amazing to see that our youth want to pay it forward already. We have youth who are already looking for ways to give back and support their community and it is just so heartwarming to see because, coming from a population that does not have that much, and to have them already want to give back whatever they can, it is really inspiring. It motivates me to do what I do even more.</p><p><strong>I really love your organisation because it provides people with opportunities to learn, grow and gain independence. To me, Kind Karma is what social entrepreneurship is all about: a complete symbiosis between social impact and business.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Learning to manage time, prioritise, find balance and have downtime was challenging [...] early on.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Now, I would like to talk more about your journey as a social entrepreneur. So, tell me, what have been the biggest challenges that you have had at the different stages of your journey?</strong></p><p>I think as a social entrepreneur, it is challenging because there is no roadmap to entrepreneurship. You can have resources along the way but it is a very unique journey for everybody. Everyone has their own challenges because everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>When I was starting out, my biggest challenge was finding balance in my life. I am very much an overachiever, I always needed to get things done immediately. I drove myself where I was just piling things on. Ultimately, I would not get anything done because it was just too much for me to accomplish in one day. I would get overwhelmed and beat myself up about it. Learning to manage time, prioritise, find balance and have downtime was challenging. There were times where I felt bad if I was not working and doing something for the business. It was easy for me to burn out and become not as good as I could be because my mental health was not optimal. So, it was definitely a challenge early on.</p><p>And now, 2020 has been kind of a crazy year. Learning how to navigate all these changes in the way that people do business and interact with each other has been a challenge. Also, get our mission and our journey out there without being able to do in-person events or meet people has been a very different challenge.</p><p><strong>It can be difficult to balance work and life in general. When you are an entrepreneur, it is even more difficult because it is your own business so you are even more involved.</strong></p><p><strong>I agree with you, it is crucial to get some time for ourselves and make sure that we are taking care of our mental and physical health, because if we are not doing great ourselves, we will not be able to do good for other people or make our business work. Right now, it has probably gotten more complicated because we are spending a lot of time at home.</strong></p><blockquote><p>In 2020 [...] it was challenging because, for a lot of youth who do not have structure or do not even have optimal or healthy domestic environments, it is hard for them to stay focused and to even be motivated to do things.</p></blockquote><p><strong>I wanted to ask you, how has the pandemic impacted your operations? I remember you were using a co-working space at a university, has that changed?</strong><br><br>That was one of our challenges too in 2020. We used to work at a small co-working space and then it shut down. So, I was hardened for a while. I mailed supplies to youth to work at home but it was challenging because, for a lot of youth who do not have structure or do not even have optimal or healthy domestic environments, it is hard for them to stay focused and to even be motivated to do things.</p><p>Finally, at the end of last year, we got our own space and we are excited to say that we are actually going to be moving again soon because we have already outgrown our space. It is a great problem to have and we are excited about that. It has always been my dream to have a space where our youth can come in, be safe, have snacks, play games, things like that. We are able to save space for them to enjoy not only work, but just life.</p><blockquote><p>It is one big community, we are all in one world, we are all working together to make it a better place, and we should all support each other regardless of what we are doing and just be kind to each other.</p></blockquote><p><strong>So, what have been your main takeaways during your journey while tackling these challenges?</strong></p><p>I am just so happy to have found this social enterprise model. I remember when I first started, it was not something that we even talked about. You would either have a nonprofit, which did good, or you would have a business, which made money, and there was no merging of the two.</p><p>It is amazing to see such a different mentality among social entrepreneurs. Some of my best friends are people who you would traditionally consider competitors, as they own jewelry companies as well, but we all just know that everybody is doing their own good in the world and it does not matter if they are selling a similar product. They are working and doing something that is also creating good change in the world. So, why can't we support each other? I love that mentality: it is one big community, we are all in one world, we are all working together to make it a better place, and we should all support each other regardless of what we are doing and just be kind to each other.</p><blockquote><p>Knowing that I have created a little bit of a difference in someone's life is the biggest achievement.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What would you say are your biggest achievements as a social entrepreneur?</strong><br> <br>Just hearing our youth saying that they came in and they felt better or that they have been able to stay here and work longer than they have in the past, that is an achievement. It means that I have created a safe and welcoming space.</p><p>Those things mean more to me than anything physical or any kind of accolades. Knowing that I have created a little bit of a difference in someone's life is the biggest achievement.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the years to come and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong><br><br>I have always wanted to help youth in major cities across the country. That is on the vision board. I always feel that, in big cities, at-risk and homeless youth always tend to fall through the cracks because they are one in millions of people and there is only so many resources that can go around. So, I would love to have a Kind Karma office in major cities from coast to coast and hopefully make an impact there.</p><p>Also, sometime in the future, maybe we will expand our offerings and do different kinds of things. I have always loved candles, so maybe something like that. That is a brainstorming project now, but I would love to expand our footprint across the country to help more youth.</p><p><strong>What other challenges are you expecting in the future?</strong></p><p>I think our next challenge might be to scale effectively. How do we make sure that, as we get bigger, everybody still has that small business feel? Or, how do we make sure that everybody still has that personal connection? Hopefully, we get bigger and get to scale, but I think every stage has its own unique challenges and I love that about it.</p><p><strong>How can people support your organisation today?</strong></p><p>They can visit our website <a href="https://kindkarma.ca/">kindkarmaco.com</a> to learn more and, obviously, we love purchases, but even just a social media follow or share, anything like that, is always so appreciated. Our Instagram handle is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kindkarmaco/">@kindkarmaco</a>. Our Facebook is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kindkarmaco">facebook.com/kindkarmaco</a>. It does not always have to be monetary support. We also appreciate everybody sharing our story and our mission.</p><p><strong>Thanks so much for sharing your story! </strong><strong>I love seeing you and talking about Kind Karma. Is there anything else that you would like to share with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong><br><br>I just want to say thank you to everyone who has supported us and who will take the time after this to look us up and read more about what we do. I cannot tell you, for us as a small business, how much that means, especially in a time where small businesses need it more than ever. So, thank you, and we really appreciate it!</p><hr><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-10.jpg" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-10-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-5.jpg" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-5-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-6.jpg" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-6-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-7.jpg" data-size="661x465"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-7-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="465"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-8.jpg" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-8-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-9.jpg" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-9-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-11.jpg" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-11-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-1.jpg" data-size="960x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-2.jpg" data-size="774x960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="893"></a></figure></div></div><p>Thanks so much for reading this post, I hope you enjoyed it!
