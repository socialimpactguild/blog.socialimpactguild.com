I am an international development professional and I have dedicated my career to eliminating poverty abroad. My work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Gender_Equality_Canada">Women and Gender Equality Canada</a>, helping with the COVID-19 response, made me wonder about the economic crisis that had accompanied the pandemic at home. So, I decided that I should use some of my expertise in the international development realm to try and help address this crisis right here at home. <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">That is where the idea for Toronto Local Currency came up.</span></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">When looking at how people deal with crises, I saw that local currency is a tool that is often used. It is not a new idea at all. Local currencies have been used since the Mesopotamian times, and were actually quite popular during the Great Depression. To this day, around 100 local currencies are operational around the world.</span></p><p><strong>What effects are you expecting from this local currency?</strong></p><p>The inspiration behind it is to get money to the people who need it most, and make sure that it actually builds a community. In international development, we would call this a conditional cash transfer. In the case of Toronto Local Currency, the condition is that they spend it locally. So, the money stays in Toronto rather than making Jeff Bezos a richer man.</p><p>Also, they must spend it on things that are actually going to improve their lives. So, there are some limitations (e.g. no lottery tickets, alcohol) to maximise impact, increase donor confidence in this vehicle and empower people. It is really about giving people the ability to make decisions for what they need the most.</p><blockquote><p>We worked with a local artist to come up with symbolism that captures the history and spirit of Toronto and Canada more broadly.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Is it a virtual currency or do you print your own money?</strong></p><p>Toronto Local Currency is actually a physical note. We have been discussing with some partners having some sort of virtual platform, but it was important for us to have this be a physical note to reduce the barriers to adoption. Some people are not tech savvy, we did not want that to be a barrier to them participating.</p><p>Also, we wanted to make sure it is secure and stable. A lot of online platforms can be hacked. By having a physical bill, you will eliminate some of that risk.</p><p>Finally, we worked with a local artist to come up with symbolism that captures the history and spirit of Toronto and Canada more broadly. It is a beautiful-looking note that I think people will not only feel pride in using but also want to buy, which is part of our revenue generating and sustainability model.<br><br><strong>You mentioned that many local currencies exist worldwide. Actually, in my hometown in Lyon, France, we also have one (<a href="http://www.lagonette.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"la Gonette"</a>). It supports the local economy and raises awareness on how currencies work. Did you get any insights from these other local currencies worldwide? </strong><br><br>Yes, the inspiration was from currencies worldwide and historical usage. There was a local currency in Toronto, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_dollar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toronto dollar</a>, that failed because of the way it was structured. Also, there was a virtual currency that was highly speculative and tied into the Bunz trading platform that also similarly failed. I examined those economic models closely to determine where mistakes were made. Toronto Local Currency is structured differently to ensure that it would have more stability and would not be speculative, so that consumers and retailers will feel confident and comfortable in using it.<br><br><strong>What exactly happened with these other currencies in Canada?</strong></p><p>The Toronto Dollar took a commission from retailers who accepted it, and donated this commission to charity. However, losing a percentage of your revenue on each transaction adds up for a small business owner. While it is great that money went to charity, it did not actually inspire business owners to adopt the currency.</p><p>We do not take any commission from our retailers and service providers who accept it. It is a way to inject liquidity into the Toronto market, help inspire more spending locally and benefit local businesses the most.</p><p>The virtual currency became far too speculative. Eventually, it was just too far removed from actual value to be real. So, the value proposition and economic model collapsed because there was no Canadian money to back the virtual one.</p><p>Toronto Local Currency is different in that every TLC is backed by a Canadian dollar. People can be confident that every TLC actually does stand for a Canadian dollar.</p><blockquote><p>TLC is a way of facilitating that cash transfer to people in need, but also adding a coolness factor for people who do not need help right now.</p></blockquote><p><strong>I saw that you are giving free TLC to people with lower income. How does this work and how do you fund it?</strong></p><p>TLC is funded by two main buckets of money. One is through donors and the other through consumers. Certainly, some people in Toronto would want to purchase TLC because it looks great, it is a symbol of local investment and local pride, and a cool souvenir.</p><p>People can buy it at an exchange rate of two to one (e.g. 20 Canadian dollars for 10 TLC). On the other hand, donors and sponsors would be donating in a regular way. Overall, TLC is a way of facilitating that cash transfer to people in need, but also adding a coolness factor for people who do not need help right now.<br><br><strong>I hope Torontonians will join you and embrace this currency!</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think that it is time for young women and visible minorities to have authority, influence and energy, and share our creativity.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Let's talk about your entrepreneurial journey. What are the biggest challenges that you have had so far?</strong></p><p>Mostly, the challenges that most young women of color face: our credentials and abilities are questioned and examined much more harshly than our white male or even white female colleagues. I remember the first time I was starting a business, seven years ago. I went to the bank to get a business account and the man across the desk kept questioning me like he could not believe that a young woman of color had started a business. I don't think that would have happened to someone who had looked different than myself in that position. I think that it is time for young women and visible minorities to have authority, influence and energy, and share our creativity.<br><br><strong>How to tackle these challenges?</strong></p><p>You cannot let the backwards thinking of a couple of people keep you from what you are meant to do. You look for allies, partners, strategic partnerships that are going to empower you. Not everyone is going to have confidence in you. Some people are going to question you, be prepared for that, but do not let it stand in your way because you might just have the idea for the next big thing that could do a lot of good and change a lot of people's lives for the better.<br><br><strong>Today, do you feel you have any challenges that you need help to overcome?</strong><br><br>We have had to do some strategic, large pivots. The project was supposed to have a much more exciting roll-out than is possible right now with the harsh lock-down in Ontario. As it is a physical currency, it requires people to be able to actually go into shops, restaurants and grooming services. Also, some of our partnerships, like with various Christmas markets, had to be cancelled. So, right now we have had to pivot to just expanding the network rather than getting the currency operational immediately.</p><p><strong>I agree that we have to adapt and try to find other ways to make things happen.<br></strong><strong>Now, let's talk about the organisation itself. What is the status of your organisation?</strong></p><p>Charitable status in Canada is actually fairly difficult to get and has quite a few restraints on what you are able to do, as well as burdensome administrative requirements. To increase our flexibility and allow this project to get off the ground early enough, we made the conscious decision to leave it as a social entrepreneurship vehicle rather than go for official charitable status.<br><br><strong>You mentioned donations earlier. Would you say you rely more on donations or people buying TLC?</strong><br><br>At this point, bearing in mind the market conditions, we rely more on donations. As the economy opens up again, I expect that will change.</p><blockquote><p>We are empowering people to make their own best decisions and to do it in a way that helps benefit the local economy.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Overall, what would you say are your biggest achievements for this project?</strong></p><p>I would say that the biggest achievement is mostly the impact that we have to empower people and give them dignity. If you provide someone with groceries that are not culturally relevant, or give a single mom a bag of groceries when what she really needs are diapers, you have helped them but you have not solved their problems.</p><p>Toronto Local Currency empowers people to solve the problems that are most pressing for them. We are empowering people to make their own best decisions and do it in a way that helps benefit the local economy. You have a two-fold benefit from one economic tool and I think that is really cool.<br><br><strong>What is your vision for the years to come and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong></p><p>We want to scale. Hopefully, this pandemic and the recession will end and we will be unnecessary. That is the thing about development projects: your greatest hope is always to put yourself out of business.</p><p>I hope that for the next few years, TLC can become a tool that is widely used in Toronto, and helps people think more about their decisions when they are buying. I hope that this is going to be a project which inspires people to buy locally and consciously.</p><hr><p>Thanks so much for reading this post, I hope you enjoyed it!</p><p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to chat with me, feel free to reach out to me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 11, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fdiving-into-local-currencies-with-tlcs-aziza-mohammed.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fdiving-into-local-currencies-with-tlcs-aziza-mohammed.html&amp;via=nphumbert&amp;text=Diving%20into%20Local%20Currencies%20with%20TLC's%20Aziza%20Mohammed" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fdiving-into-local-currencies-with-tlcs-aziza-mohammed.html&amp;title=Diving%20into%20Local%20Currencies%20with%20TLC's%20Aziza%20Mohammed" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/tags/interview/">Interview</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/website/nadia.png" loading="lazy" alt="Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz"><div><h3><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/authors/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz/" class="invert" rel="author">Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz</a></h3><p>Entrepreneur, consultant, bio-sciences and software engineer, working on projects to effect social impact.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments"><div class="post__inner"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
