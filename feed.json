His innovative idea is to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210713-how-pedestrians-are-lighting-homes-in-sierra-leone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage kinetic energy</a> ‚Äì the energy objects have when in motion ‚Äì to generate clean electricity.</p>\n<p>When he was 17, he designed a piezoelectric device that harnesses energy from heat, movement and pressure. When installed under a road, it absorbs vibrations from the ongoing traffic to generate electric current -- without any external power source nor emissions!</p>\n<p>With only two devices, Optim Energy managed to provide free-of-charge power to 150 households and 15 schools. However, the benefits for the community go beyond its energy needs. Indeed, children's health and school performance improved once they gained access to lighting and lived in smoke-free homes. Also, street lightning increased safety in the neighbourhood, which allowed businesses to stay open later into the evening. Finally, deforestation fell in the area since people no longer rely on firewood.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In Sierra Leone, only 26% of the population has access to electricity. In rural areas, this proportion plunges to 6%. Most families, therefore, rely on charcoal and firewood to generate heat and light, which leads to poor health conditions and frequent house fires. Moreover, the related deforestation made the country highly vulnerable to climate change, extreme flooding and landslides.</p>\n<p>By 2030, Optim Energy intends to provide power to 100,000 people as well as health clinics throughout Sierra Leone. Jeremiah believes that access to energy is a human right. Through his startup, he is developing a sustainable energy system while enhancing education, health and safety in his community ü§©</p>\n<p>(Source: bbc.com)</p>\n<h2 id=\"cows\">üêÑ The Device That Reduces Cows‚Äô Methane Emissions</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/cow.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1153\" height=\"649\"></figure>Francisco Norris and his brother Patricio come from a cattle-ranching family in Argentina. In the UK, they founded <a href=\"https://www.zelp.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zelp</a>, a company that aims to capture methane emissions at the source.</p>\n<p>Because of their background, they knew that cows exhale most of the methane through their mouth and nostrils, so they designed a device that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90658025/this-mask-for-cows-isnt-for-covid-it-helps-reduce-methane-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sits above the cow‚Äôs nose</a> and detects methane. When its level passes a certain threshold, the device absorbs the gas and turns it into water vapour and CO2 -- a far less potent greenhouse gas. According to their research, they can reduce the animal‚Äôs emissions to less than 2% of their original value!</p>\n<p>Fransisco insisted that the mechanism remained practical for cattle to wear and did not affect them in any way. While testing the prototype, the team thus made sure to monitor any signs of discomfort, such as changes in how much a cow ate, to implement this vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In a year, the billion cows and bulls on the planet can each release 200 pounds of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2. Over the next few decades, the United Nations predicts that beef and dairy consumption will rise by 70%, increasing the global cattle population and associated emissions.</p>\n<p>The Zelp device, which should be on the market in 2022, is designed to last 4 years on a cow without requiring any replacement or recharge. Since it also captures and tracks emissions, farmers will increase their margins by featuring the environmental benefit of their milk and even add a new revenue stream by selling carbon credits.</p>\n<p>(Source: fastcompany.com)</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<h2 id=\"pick\">üéØ The Guild‚Äôs Pick</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/reef.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>The Sri Lankan government gives decommissioned buses a second life by sinking them in the ocean to serve as <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2021/07/next-stop-the-sea-sri-lankas-old-buses-are-a-new-home-for-marine-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fish-breeding sites</a>.

During their experiments, Pennie‚Äôs team placed 300 mussels in a tank and found that they filtered out more than 250,000 microplastics per hour! The mussels eventually excrete the microplastics, which naturally sink into the water and become readily disposable. All this happens without causing any harm to the mussels.</p>\n<p>In the future, Pennie also hopes to use the plastic-filled excrements as a biofuel since they are rich in carbon.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Collecting microplastic is difficult. Projects like the <a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/turning-face-masks-into-trees-and-cleaning-up-the-ocean#cleanup-ocean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ocean Cleanup</a> can gather large pieces of plastic, but no organization has yet managed to extract smaller particles at scale.
