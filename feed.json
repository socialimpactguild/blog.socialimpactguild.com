Indeed, akin to most herbs, this essential ingredient for pesto prefers protected, sunny locations with well-drained soils and a constant, stable temperature - everything the bottom of the sea can provide!</p>\n<p>From this question, Sergio created <a href=\"http://www.nemosgarden.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nemo’s Garden</a>. This project consists of transparent, air-filled biospheres 20 feet below the sea surface to create an alternative agriculture system.</p>\n<p>Underwater agriculture presents many advantages over standard agriculture. First, the biospheres are self-sustainable in terms of water. Indeed, the seawater at the biospheres' bottom evaporates and condensates on the internal surfaces, creating fresh water for the plants. Also, since the biospheres contain a parasite-free closed ecosystem, no pesticide is necessary. Finally, data have shown Sergio’s team that higher pressure conditions positively affect plant growth.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, current experiments demonstrated that the amount of sunlight illuminating the biosphere is sufficient to allow the plants to grow.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Today, <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70% of global fresh water</a> is used for agriculture, and the growing population will further increase the pressure on water resources. In this context, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change.</p>\n<p>For now, Nemo’s Garden is an experiment, and underwater agriculture's limits are yet to be defined. However, this project is extremely interesting for our planet's future as it uses renewable energy from the sun and generates fresh water from sea water desalination.</p>\n<h2 id=\"laser\">🐞 The Team That Wants to Replace Pesticides With Laser Beams</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/pea.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1081\"></figure>\n<p>A team of researchers in Lyon, France, leveraged their knowledge in artificial intelligence to develop a technology that identifies and removes pest from plants.

He thought these corals were lost and forgot about them. A few weeks later, he came back to the aquarium and noticed that they had not only survived but multiplied and grown. By pursuing his research, he discovered that small pieces of coral placed close to each other would grow together and fuse back as one piece.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this micro-fragmentation process, growth and healing happen up to 40 times faster than they occur naturally on the reef.

They provide habitats for numerous fish (including Nemo and Dory!), and fisheries depend on them for up to 40% of their catch. Coral reefs are also the rainforests of the sea: they absorb heaps of carbon dioxide and produce a large amount of the oxygen we breathe. Finally, they protect the shorelines from waves and storms and help mitigate climate change effects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time to find Nemo has passed.

This African-led movement has the ambition to grow an 8,000km natural wonder of the world across the entire width of Africa.

The Sahel forms a transitional zone between the Sahara desert and the rainforest and is one of the poorest places on Earth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once complete, the Great Green Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet, 3 times bigger than Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Since its beginning in 2007, this initiative brought food security, jobs and stability to locals. More than just growing trees and plants, the Great Green Wall is thus transforming millions of lives in the Sahel region. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the region became virtually uncultivable due to climate change and deforestation. The lack of rainwater allows saltwater from the sea to move upstream and destroy crops. Moreover, without trees, the soil has lost all its nutrients, and crops don’t grow. This situation led to biodiversity loss, poverty, mass emigration, violence and food insecurity. The Great Green Wall isn’t just for the Sahel, though. It could contribute to solving the world’s pressing threats – notably climate change, drought, famine, conflict and migration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: pioneerspost.com)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">📌 Google </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/04/22/google-maps-recycling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Google Maps would display featured businesses’ sustainable practices.

Having a schedule and a routine is essential to free time dedicated to learning. For instance, grouping meetings together can be useful to avoid context switching.</li>\n<li><strong>Collecting feedback</strong>. While talking with the people you want to help, you should take any opportunity to understand their biggest pain points and adapt your offer accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Leveraging tools and automation</strong>. Handling everything manually is not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, you should automate as much as possible, as soon as possible, to focus your energy on learning and performing other high-value tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Asking for help</strong>. You are not supposed to learn everything by yourself. W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hen a topic is outside your area of expertise, consider reaching out to people who can provide you with insights into the subject at hand.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Accepting mistakes</strong>. Mistakes happen, and you should not beat yourself up over them. The key is to learn from them and use these experiences to improve and make better decisions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Testing your ideas early</strong>. D<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on't wait for your product to be perfect. Instead, try to discard or validate your assumptions early on. The later you find out about a wrong assumption, the greater the cost. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Trusting the process</strong>. Growing an organization takes time. So be patient, appreciate what you are achieving, celebrate the victories - whatever their magnitude - and try to avoid frustration in the face of adversity.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at what you can give to people. It's not always money. It's not always your time. It's also your expertise, your knowledge. I believe everybody has something to give.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Once it is full, a boat comes and collects the “garbage”.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/1-Clean-Ocean.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Ocean-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Ocean-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Ocean-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"System to gather floating plastic pollution in the ocean\" width=\"516\" height=\"405\"></figure>Otherwise, they aim to deploy “interceptors” in the 1,000 most polluted rivers worldwide within the next 5 years. Basically, the system consists of a couple of fixed floaters that redirect the waste into conveyor belts collecting the plastic.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/1-Clean-Rivers.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Rivers-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Rivers-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1-Clean-Rivers-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"System to gather floating plastic pollution in the rivers\" width=\"645\" height=\"363\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This project proves that we don’t need ultra-sophisticated technology to make a real difference.

            "content_html": "<p>With Hillary Scanlon, Founder and CEO at STIL Solutions, we discussed how to bridge the gap between accessibility and sustainability and uncovered insights into turning barriers to (sustainability) behaviours into business opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>About STIL Solutions</h2>\n<p>STIL (<em>Sustainability Through an Inclusive Lens</em>) Solutions founder Hillary Scanlon lost her vision unexpectedly and suddenly in 2016. Hillary, only one year later, turned her frustration with the inaccessibility of built-in environments and the inability to participate in sustainability initiatives into a business opportunity.</p>\n<p>Her social enterprise intends to bridge the gap between sustainability and accessibility in the area of waste management. It provides organizations with WasteFinder, a shape-and-colour-based waste management system for public spaces, accessible to people of all abilities.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/WasteFinder.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"WasteFinder\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\">\n<figcaption >WasteFinder installed in a public space.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>STIL Solutions has already been working with 18 customers across Ontario, creating more inclusive spaces for people with vision loss, people living with blindness, young children who cannot yet read, or people who do not speak the language commonly used on signage. It also contributes to the standardization of waste management.</p>\n<p>The end goal is to \"empower everyone to be a steward of their environment and divert as much waste as possible from landfill.\" Hillary wants to make all public spaces accessible to people of all abilities from a sustainability perspective for the years to come.<br><br>To support STIL Solutions, follow them on Instagram and check out their website. You can also spread the word about their initiative and contact them if you want to implement their solution!</p>\n<h2 class=\"align-left\">Insights Into Turning Lack of Accessibility Into Business Opportunities</h2>\n<h3>Barrier Identification</h3>\n<p>It comes down to understanding the behaviours necessary for the cause you want to participate in (e.g. being more environmentally friendly) and asking yourself whether everyone can participate in that cause, regardless of their ability.</p>\n<p>By applying this approach to your context, you can turn barriers into business opportunities by removing them. \"It is important to recognize these gaps and act upon them,\" Hillary underlines.</p>\n<h3>Acknowledging Some Potential Challenges</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, technology might not always be the answer to your problem. For instance, Hillary wants to address the accessibility of built-in environments to participate in sustainability initiatives and did not want to \"place the responsibility of accessibility on the individual with the disability to have data on their phone and download an app.\"</p>\n<p>However, it can be more challenging to access funding without it. Also, when tapping into something innovative, it might become imperative to spend time and resources educating people to build credibility instead of focusing solely on growing. Moreover, very few women-led startups receive VC funding.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, it can be easy to burn out while running a low-tech social enterprise as a woman.</p>\n<h3>Ideas To Help You Thrive</h3>\n<p>We uncovered a set of factors that might help you thrive, despite the difficulties.</p>\n<p>First, it is crucial to understand that you need to <strong>enjoy the process</strong> and not only the end goal itself. So, make sure to put systems in place to enjoy your entrepreneurial journey and take care of yourself along the way. </p>\n<p>Also, having a clear<strong> understanding </strong>of what you are trying to achieve is necessary to ensure your actions are always aligned with your objectives and avoid strategic drift.</p>\n<p>Finally, constant and ongoing <strong>communication</strong> with the community and stakeholders is essential. Hillary highlights that \"people with disabilities with diverse backgrounds and experiences\" informed all of her business decisions. She indicates this has allowed her to ensure her products will make a real impact. So, be always open to expanding your network and gathering feedback.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Disability is one of the only marginalized identities that we are all going to experience at some point in our lives because of injuries, temporary illnesses, age, among others. So, even if you think that this might not apply to you now, it is within everyone's best interest to make the environment more accessible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-1.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-3.png\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-3-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-4.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your story, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",
