Indeed, the official term to refer to people with disabilities until the mid-1980s was \"<em>Canfei\"—</em>a combination of two Chinese characters meaning \"incomplete\" and \"useless.\" Today, things are shifting, and several groups are pushing to start using other terms.</p>\n<p>Home of Hope is a safe space where its members feel accepted and understood.

Their secret is to find species that can handle conditions colder than the tropics to flourish in European greenhouses.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Les Arts Verts grow their food according to the organic certification ECOCERT. In particular, they cultivate their tropical produce in living spaces, using polyculture to keep the soil rich and increase biodiversity. Also, they do not heat their greenhouses but equip them with solar panels to put clean electricity back into the grid.</p>\n<p>Finally, this farm collaborates with the greatest French chefs—including a Michelin-starred restaurant— to provide them with zero-carbon exotic products.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Bananas and mangos are among the preferred fruits in France.

            "content_html": "<p>Today, 80% of Napa Valley winemakers use owls to control their rodent population, while less than 20% use rodenticide instead.</p>\n\n<p>Farmers realized that they only needed to build nest boxes near their fields to attract owls and reap the benefits. For example, a farmer with 20 owl boxes can expect those owls to catch around 70,000 rodents per year — which represents a cost of 26 cents per rodent, against several dollars for traditional methods (e.g. trapping, rodenticide).</p>\n<p>Replacing pesticides with barn owls for rodent control is part of a broader environmentally sustainable trend among Napa Valley farmers. Indeed, many also reduce their water consumption in the face of Californian droughts and plant perennial grass between rows to prevent the dangers of monoculture.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> For decades, Napa Valley's wineries relied on pesticides to prevent rodents from damaging their crops. However, this strategy, coupled with grapes-only monoculture and the usage of commercial fertilizer, generated a toxic taint in certain wines, demonstrating the need for more sustainable practices. In January 2021, California passed a law restricting rodenticides, but lobbying created a loophole for agricultural use.</p>\n<p>Although still technically authorized, Napa's growers turned away from rodenticides because they understood that people and nature depend on each other to thrive. Also, they took this opportunity to make a few raptor friends along the way.</p>\n<p>(source: <a href=\"https://baynature.org/article/raptors-rather-than-rodenticide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">baynature.org</a>)</p>",

However, wind turbines for homes have encountered very slow uptake due, in part, to their intrusive physicality. As a result, wind turbines flourish mainly offshore, where nobody can see them. This situation leads to wasting potential energy sources in cities prone to strong winds, such as Wellington (New Zealand), Perth (Australia), Chicago or Boston (USA).</p>\n<p>Joe's kinetic wall can be a gamechanger in these urban areas by covering all their energy needs.</p>",
