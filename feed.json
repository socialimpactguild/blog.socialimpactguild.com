Indeed, pain is more acute when we are stressed out or overly focused on it. But, on the other hand, our body produces natural endorphins, which are a neurochemical analgesic, when we’re having fun.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/43/3/266/4558507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> demonstrate that VR <span class=\"break-words\"><span dir=\"ltr\">–</span></span> especially interactive games <span class=\"break-words\"><span dir=\"ltr\">–</span></span> is significantly more effective than any other distraction for pain management. Indeed, our brain is unable to tell the difference between a virtual and a real environment.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VR can have a broad range of usages, from purely managing pain to eliminating anxiety or simply distracting a kid to make them stay still. Whatever the use case, it always reduces the need for drugs and prevents the associated side effects (e.g. adverse reaction, addiction). Also, using VR before surgeries can lead to shorter recovery times and better overall postoperative outcomes. Otherwise, nurses and doctors are more relaxed and are in better dispositions to do a great job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a refreshing change of pace to see video games and technology being praised for their health benefits, especially when it means reducing the need for pain medication and sedation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: </span><a href=\"https://dot.la/virtual-reality-pain-management-2654980900.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dot.la</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"toys\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🐻 The Adoption Agency for Preloved Teddy Bears</span></h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/teddy-bear-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1439\" height=\"810\"></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the UK, </span><a href=\"https://www.lovedbefore.london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loved Before</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opened a “soft toy adoption agency” to promote sustainability in the industry and give preloved toys a second life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creator, Charlotte Liebling, witnessed the massive amount of toys donated and thrown away when she worked in a charity shop. Her social enterprise wants to encourage people to buy pre-owned soft toys and change the perceptions around second-hand items.

While most wind turbines start at 3 m/s, the Wind Tulip is already producing 25-30 watts at this speed. Moreover, traditional turbines cannot be placed close together at the risk of interfering with each other. On the other hand, Wind Tulips drive wind tunnels into each other -- making their neighbours perform 20-50% better. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to these innovations, these good-looking turbines are extremely efficient (up to 40%, against 7-10% for their conventional counterparts), especially under slow wind and in limited spaces. They are, therefore, particularly adapted to urban settings.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wind farms' opponents often cite noise and biodiversity concerns along with aesthetic issues. As a result, city residents do not leverage wind energy, despite its huge potential, and rely on solar power as a local source of clean energy. However, the latter doesn’t perform well at night or during the winter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wind Tulips make wind energy available for everybody by allowing people to live and work next to them. Coupled with already existing solar energy sources, they could be the future of locally-produced urban clean energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">theguardian.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"pick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/bison.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Quad Cities, USA, the </span><a href=\"https://bisonbridge.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bison Bridge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> project aims to repurpose Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge on Interstate I-80 to create a wildlife crossing that provides safe passage for bison herds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides saving Illinois millions in demolition costs, this initiative could also attract tourists to this somewhat overlooked part of the country.

His innovative idea is to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210713-how-pedestrians-are-lighting-homes-in-sierra-leone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage kinetic energy</a> – the energy objects have when in motion – to generate clean electricity.</p>\n<p>When he was 17, he designed a piezoelectric device that harnesses energy from heat, movement and pressure. When installed under a road, it absorbs vibrations from the ongoing traffic to generate electric current -- without any external power source nor emissions!</p>\n<p>With only two devices, Optim Energy managed to provide free-of-charge power to 150 households and 15 schools. However, the benefits for the community go beyond its energy needs. Indeed, children's health and school performance improved once they gained access to lighting and lived in smoke-free homes. Also, street lightning increased safety in the neighbourhood, which allowed businesses to stay open later into the evening. Finally, deforestation fell in the area since people no longer rely on firewood.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In Sierra Leone, only 26% of the population has access to electricity. In rural areas, this proportion plunges to 6%. Most families, therefore, rely on charcoal and firewood to generate heat and light, which leads to poor health conditions and frequent house fires. Moreover, the related deforestation made the country highly vulnerable to climate change, extreme flooding and landslides.</p>\n<p>By 2030, Optim Energy intends to provide power to 100,000 people as well as health clinics throughout Sierra Leone. Jeremiah believes that access to energy is a human right. Through his startup, he is developing a sustainable energy system while enhancing education, health and safety in his community 🤩</p>\n<p>(Source: bbc.com)</p>\n<h2 id=\"cows\">🐄 The Device That Reduces Cows’ Methane Emissions</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/cow.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1153\" height=\"649\"></figure>Francisco Norris and his brother Patricio come from a cattle-ranching family in Argentina. In the UK, they founded <a href=\"https://www.zelp.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zelp</a>, a company that aims to capture methane emissions at the source.</p>\n<p>Because of their background, they knew that cows exhale most of the methane through their mouth and nostrils, so they designed a device that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90658025/this-mask-for-cows-isnt-for-covid-it-helps-reduce-methane-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sits above the cow’s nose</a> and detects methane. When its level passes a certain threshold, the device absorbs the gas and turns it into water vapour and CO2 -- a far less potent greenhouse gas. According to their research, they can reduce the animal’s emissions to less than 2% of their original value!</p>\n<p>Fransisco insisted that the mechanism remained practical for cattle to wear and did not affect them in any way. While testing the prototype, the team thus made sure to monitor any signs of discomfort, such as changes in how much a cow ate, to implement this vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In a year, the billion cows and bulls on the planet can each release 200 pounds of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2. Over the next few decades, the United Nations predicts that beef and dairy consumption will rise by 70%, increasing the global cattle population and associated emissions.</p>\n<p>The Zelp device, which should be on the market in 2022, is designed to last 4 years on a cow without requiring any replacement or recharge. Since it also captures and tracks emissions, farmers will increase their margins by featuring the environmental benefit of their milk and even add a new revenue stream by selling carbon credits.</p>\n<p>(Source: fastcompany.com)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"pick\">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/reef.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>The Sri Lankan government gives decommissioned buses a second life by sinking them in the ocean to serve as <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2021/07/next-stop-the-sea-sri-lankas-old-buses-are-a-new-home-for-marine-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fish-breeding sites</a>.

Of course, the agency checked the buses were free of pollutants beforehand.</p>\n<p>On land, old buses take up space and offer a pretty poor view. Moreover, they collect rainwater, creating mosquito-breeding sites and contributing to diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. On the other hand, once in the water, they become tourist attractions, on top of the ecological benefits they provide.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Most natural Sri Lankan natural fish breeding spots have been lost to climate change, natural disasters and destructive fishing practices.
