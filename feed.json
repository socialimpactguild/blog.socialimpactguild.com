            "content_html": "<p>In Shanghai, Home of Hope is the city's first dance group that includes only people with paraplegia, aiming to reshape perceptions of accessibility in China.</p>\n\n<p>After a car accident in 2012, Pan Jing—a Chinese professional dancer—undertook spinal cord rehabilitation at Shanghai's Sunshine Medical Rehabilitation Centre. There, she had the idea to create dance routines for people in wheelchairs.</p>\n<p>Since forming in 2014, the dancers have performed more than 70 shows, including some on national television. The group inspired many patients along the way and helped its members process their traumatic experiences. Today, the people involved hope its influence will spread outside of the program to reach more people with disabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In China, people with disabilities often encounter physical and social barriers as the country has stigmatized disability for a long time. Indeed, the official term to refer to people with disabilities until the mid-1980s was \"<em>Canfei\"—</em>a combination of two Chinese characters meaning \"incomplete\" and \"useless.\"</p>\n<p>Home of Hope is a safe space where its members feel accepted and understood. They hope their performances can play a part in changing Chinese society's views regarding disabilities.</p>",

But, <strong>human intervention</strong> remodelled the landscape and replaced these forests with paved areas that redirect water straight into rivers and lakes, overflowing them in the process.</li>\n<li>The <strong>growing population</strong> led to the creation of entire neighbourhoods in areas with a significant risk of flooding. Each flood can also affect more people since urban areas are denser and denser.</li>\n<li>As a result, floods would be more serious even without climate change. However, <strong>global warming</strong> also plays its part by evaporating more water from the ocean and letting the warmer atmosphere hold a greater volume of water, increasing rainfalls' intensity. Moreover, droughts make the soil extremely dry and compact—impeding its ability to absorb and retain water.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a nutshell, global warming worsens the rainfalls, and many factors reduce the land's ability to drain water properly. In British Columbia, the main causes for these extreme floods include the proximity to the ocean, intensive logging, and having drained the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumas_Lake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sumas Lake</a> artificially to create fertile farmlands 100 years ago. Last week, the overflow from the nearby rivers refilled the Sumas Lake, as anticipated by a <a href=\"https://www.abbotsford.ca/sites/default/files/2021-02/Nooksack%20Overflow%20Final%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 report</a>.</p>\n<p>With work from home becoming more pervasive, we don't necessarily need to live in urban areas anymore—helping us build a world more resilient towards floods.</p>",
