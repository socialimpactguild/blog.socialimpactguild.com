His innovative idea is to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210713-how-pedestrians-are-lighting-homes-in-sierra-leone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage kinetic energy</a> – the energy objects have when in motion – to generate clean electricity.</p>\n<p>When he was 17, he designed a piezoelectric device that harnesses energy from heat, movement and pressure. When installed under a road, it absorbs vibrations from the ongoing traffic to generate electric current -- without any external power source nor emissions!</p>\n<p>With only two devices, Optim Energy managed to provide free-of-charge power to 150 households and 15 schools. However, the benefits for the community go beyond its energy needs. Indeed, children's health and school performance improved once they gained access to lighting and lived in smoke-free homes. Also, street lightning increased safety in the neighbourhood, which allowed businesses to stay open later into the evening. Finally, deforestation fell in the area since people no longer rely on firewood.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In Sierra Leone, only 26% of the population has access to electricity. In rural areas, this proportion plunges to 6%. Most families, therefore, rely on charcoal and firewood to generate heat and light, which leads to poor health conditions and frequent house fires. Moreover, the related deforestation made the country highly vulnerable to climate change, extreme flooding and landslides.</p>\n<p>By 2030, Optim Energy intends to provide power to 100,000 people as well as health clinics throughout Sierra Leone. Jeremiah believes that access to energy is a human right. Through his startup, he is developing a sustainable energy system while enhancing education, health and safety in his community 🤩</p>\n<p>(Source: bbc.com)</p>\n<h2 id=\"cows\">🐄 The Device That Reduces Cows’ Methane Emissions</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/cow.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1153\" height=\"649\"></figure>Francisco Norris and his brother Patricio come from a cattle-ranching family in Argentina. In the UK, they founded <a href=\"https://www.zelp.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zelp</a>, a company that aims to capture methane emissions at the source.</p>\n<p>Because of their background, they knew that cows exhale most of the methane through their mouth and nostrils, so they designed a device that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90658025/this-mask-for-cows-isnt-for-covid-it-helps-reduce-methane-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sits above the cow’s nose</a> and detects methane. When its level passes a certain threshold, the device absorbs the gas and turns it into water vapour and CO2 -- a far less potent greenhouse gas. According to their research, they can reduce the animal’s emissions to less than 2% of their original value!</p>\n<p>Fransisco insisted that the mechanism remained practical for cattle to wear and did not affect them in any way. While testing the prototype, the team thus made sure to monitor any signs of discomfort, such as changes in how much a cow ate, to implement this vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In a year, the billion cows and bulls on the planet can each release 200 pounds of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2. Over the next few decades, the United Nations predicts that beef and dairy consumption will rise by 70%, increasing the global cattle population and associated emissions.</p>\n<p>The Zelp device, which should be on the market in 2022, is designed to last 4 years on a cow without requiring any replacement or recharge. Since it also captures and tracks emissions, farmers will increase their margins by featuring the environmental benefit of their milk and even add a new revenue stream by selling carbon credits.</p>\n<p>(Source: fastcompany.com)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"pick\">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/reef.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>The Sri Lankan government gives decommissioned buses a second life by sinking them in the ocean to serve as <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2021/07/next-stop-the-sea-sri-lankas-old-buses-are-a-new-home-for-marine-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fish-breeding sites</a>. The Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR) has already sunk dozens of buses at three sites.</p>\n<p>So far, the results are encouraging as the buses have already attracted a lot of fish. Indeed, a bus body structure seems to be ideal for fish to gather around and is also perfect for accumulating algae, mollusks, and corals. Of course, the agency checked the buses were free of pollutants beforehand.</p>\n<p>On land, old buses take up space and offer a pretty poor view. Moreover, they collect rainwater, creating mosquito-breeding sites and contributing to diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. On the other hand, once in the water, they become tourist attractions, on top of the ecological benefits they provide.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Most natural Sri Lankan natural fish breeding spots have been lost to climate change, natural disasters and destructive fishing practices. Protecting these habitats and stopping illegal fishing practices are, therefore, crucial for the country’s biodiversity.</p>\n<p>By repurposing old bus carcasses, the Sri Lankan government implemented an innovative idea that will please both biodiversity and scuba diving enthusiasts 🤿</p>\n<p>(Source: news.mongabay.com)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</h2>\n<p>🤖 4ocean and Poralu Marine partnered to create a <a href=\"https://www.4ocean.com/pages/4ocean-x-poralu-bebot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">robot that picks up microplastics</a> on beaches.

Specifically, her team <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90655823/mussels-can-be-a-natural-filter-to-remove-microplastic-from-the-ocean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uses mussels</a> to filter water and extract tiny pieces of plastic – smaller than 5 millimetres across – generated from plastic pollution disintegration.</p>\n<p>As it feeds, an adult mussel can filter up to 55 litres of water a day. During their experiments, Pennie’s team placed 300 mussels in a tank and found that they filtered out more than 250,000 microplastics per hour! The mussels eventually excrete the microplastics, which naturally sink into the water and become readily disposable. All this happens without causing any harm to the mussels.</p>\n<p>In the future, Pennie also hopes to use the plastic-filled excrements as a biofuel since they are rich in carbon.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Collecting microplastic is difficult. Projects like the <a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/turning-face-masks-into-trees-and-cleaning-up-the-ocean#cleanup-ocean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ocean Cleanup</a> can gather large pieces of plastic, but no organization has yet managed to extract smaller particles at scale. By leveraging nature’s potential, this project could uncover a way to tackle microplastic pollution naturally 😎</p>\n<p>(source: fastcompany.com)</p>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</h2>\n<p>🏊‍ The residents of New York City might soon be able to swim in the famously polluted Hudson River. To achieve this feat, the non-profit organization <a href=\"https://pluspool.org/pool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">+ POOL</a> designed a plus-shaped, water-filtering, floating swimming pool. Once deployed, this 9,000 square foot pool will filter 600,000 gallons per day -- cleaning the river bit by bit while letting New Yorkers enjoy a new recreational space.</p>\n<p>🚲 In Finland, you can now go to your library to borrow books and <a href=\"https://www.treehugger.com/finnish-library-loans-out-e-cargo-bikes-for-free-5191645\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">e-cargo bikes</a>! The goal is to remove barriers to adoption by lending box bikes – ideal for carrying children, groceries etc. – for free. This initiative proves once again that libraries are vital to our communities 🤩</p>\n<p>💧 A team of Korean researchers developed a nanofiber membrane that can <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-filter-is-really-good-at-turning-seawater-into-fre-1847220376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turn salt water into fresh water</a> in minutes by rejecting 99.99% of salt while staying fully dry. This groundbreaking innovation could help the 900 million people worldwide who lack a clean source of drinking water.</p>\n<p>👕 Lululemon, the athletic apparel retailer, is experimenting with the first-ever fabric made <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90655566/lululemon-is-experimenting-with-the-first-fabric-made-from-recycled-carbon-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from ethanol produced by pollution-eating bacteria</a>. The company partnered with LanzaTech, a biotech startup that turns pollution into ethanol and uses it as feedstock to produce polyester. The resulting fabric is completely identical to regular polyester and could pave the way to a future without fossil-carbon-based clothes.</p>\n<p>👟 Honda, the Japanese car company, designed an <a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2021/6/honda-navigation-system-in-shoe-gps-visually-impaired-people-wearable-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in-shoe navigation system</a> for people with vision loss. The system includes a three-dimensional vibration device and a motion sensor attached inside the shoe. The associated app can guide the person by making their foot vibrate in the required direction. This mechanism is insensitive to ambient noises and leaves users free to use their hands.</p>\n<p>🎵 When the musician Yoko Sen had to spend time in a hospital, she noticed that the surrounding sound affected her ability to recuperate. So as soon as she recovered, she created <a href=\"http://www.sensound.space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SenSound</a> to humanize hospital sounds. Almost 80% of sounds in the ER come from patient monitoring, and making them more soothing can go a long way towards improving patients’ journey and recovery.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<h1>😍 Wholesomeness</h1>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/32/dog-2.jfif\" alt=\"\" width=\"633\" height=\"998\"></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>That’s a wrap.
