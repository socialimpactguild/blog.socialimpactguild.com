            "content_html": "<p>With Charlene Nadaline, Founder and CEO at Amintro, we talked about the reality of social isolation and uncovered insights into building a sustainable free platform to genuinely help people while generating enough revenues to sustain your purpose.</p>\n\n<h2>About Amintro</h2>\n<p>What started as a desire to help Amintro founder Charlene Nadalin's mother became a concrete initiative to foster friendship among people over 50 in North America.</p>\n<p>Amintro from Latin <em>amica - introduction</em> (literally <em>friends</em> - <em>introduction</em>) provides baby boomers and seniors with a free platform to let them find a group of friends with which they can share time and experiences to avoid loneliness and social isolation. It also features relevant editorial content about how to live healthier and happier.</p>\n<p>\"The reality is that social isolation and loneliness is a global epidemic,\" Charlene says. Amintro envisions becoming a global brand and solution to help seniors and their families.</p>\n<p>To support Amintro, Charlene underlines you can spread the word about their social platform to create more opportunities for people to connect and contact them if you want to become part of the solution.</p>\n<h2>Insights Into Building a Sustainable Free Platform</h2>\n<p>You can stay true to your values and develop an inclusive and sustainable business without having to opt for a freemium model.</p>\n<p>To do so, you need to define <strong>one </strong>revenue model and roll it out to develop and test your platform, Charlene shares. The idea is to understand the relevance of other potential revenue models and discover new revenue streams along the way. She highlights that you can only do so once you have built your product.</p>\n<p><strong>So,</strong> <strong>how to develop a relevant and robust first revenue model?</strong></p>\n<p>If possible, leverage your previous experiences and professional network to define the clientele that will help you keep the platform free.</p>\n<p>Charlene used her extensive marketing and editorial sales experience to develop partnerships with organisations that sponsor the content in her platform, helping her sustain Amintro. \"You need to know your clientele, understand their needs and pain points. [I realised that] I had a network of past clients who may benefit from what we are doing at Amintro,\" she explains.</p>\n<p>Amintro's partners include financial institutions, insurance companies, travel agencies, food manufacturers, among others, that provide services and products to support her target demographic. Note that these partnerships are also <strong>aligned</strong> with the company's purpose as they allow giving seniors access to valuable information for their mental and physical well-being.</p>\n<p>In terms of marketing, your positioning can significantly differ between your clientele and the people you want to support.</p>\n<p>To scale up your purpose and increase your impact, it might be necessary to consider fundraising. \"We have identified other opportunities for our stakeholders that will generate revenue, and we are [, therefore,] going into fundraising to build out our intellectual property and technology\".</p>\n<p>During the whole process, do not hesitate to look out for help in the areas that you do not know well, use the available resources, and build relationships with people who share your values.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have learned through all of this that people want to see you succeed and are generous with their knowledge and experience. They are very much willing and happy to answer your questions or to provide some form of assistance, whatever that may be. That is not something that I realised before starting the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your experience, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>With Kayli Dale, Co-founder and CEO at A Friendlier Company, we discussed how to make reuse accessible and uncovered insights into kick-starting your own (social) venture.</p>\n\n<h2>About A Friendlier Company</h2>\n<p>After graduating from the University of Waterloo, Kayli Dale and Jacqueline Hutchings founded A Friendlier Company to simplify reuse and make it \"as convenient and accessible to everybody as possible\".<br><br>It all started during their co-op experiences abroad, which exposed them to sustainable practices and circular packaging systems they had not seen yet in Canada. These eye-opening experiences, notably in the Scandinavian countries, inspired them to use reverse logistics to create \"a solid process that would enable the reuse of packaging\".<br><br>Launched less than six months ago, amid the pandemic, A Friendlier Company has already rapidly expanded to support several Ontarian areas thanks to the support of the people who have \"rallied behind the foodservice businesses in [their] program,\" she says. As a result, Kayli explains they have reused \"over 5,000 containers that are equivalent to diverting 600 pounds of waste from landfill\".Â <br><br>For the years to come, they keep in mind that they want to \"create a system for the average consumer and not just people who are [interested] in sustainability\" to broaden their impact. So, they envision further expansion across Ontario to reach more people.<br><br>To support them, you can ask your favourite restaurants and takeout places for reusables! You can also join their social media platforms and download their app to find locations using their system readily.</p>\n<h2>Insights into Kick-Starting a Social Venture</h2>\n<h3>Finding the Idea</h3>\n<p>\"Find a problem that you are passionate about. It is not an easy journey! If you do not feel incredibly passionate about what you are doing, and if it does not give you the motivation to keep going, it is going to be tough.\", Kayli underlines.</p>\n<p>The idea is to make sure to \"choose a problem that<strong> needs </strong>solving,\" and you are willing to put the effort in to solve it.</p>\n<h3>First Steps</h3>\n<p>Kayli believes it is crucial always to be adaptable and <strong>resilient</strong>. A Friendlier Company faced two significant obstacles at the beginning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Being constantly <strong>rejected</strong>; and</span></li>\n<li>Targeting large event venues and having to deal with COVID-19 (e.g. large unsold inventory).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, they <strong>adjusted quickly </strong>to the changes taking place in the market and \"built a system that would work during the pandemic\" and would tackle the ongoing increase in takeout waste. They also adopted an iterative and focused approach that helped them move forward.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Kayli highlights that \"every piece of [their] process was a big undertaking,\" and they leveraged their previous exposure to the startup world and experiences to design this process. According to her, other essential factors to the company's success include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applying to various programs;</li>\n<li><strong>Networking </strong>with as many people as possible; and</li>\n<li>Being willing to change your mind about your ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scaling-up</h3>\n<p>Raising equity enables growth and scaling-up quickly to make a significant impact. A Friendlier Company won funding through programs first, then small equity fundraising and now they are contemplating opening up their pre-seed.</p>\n<p>They also work with a few groups from various universities (from engineering to marketing) and are hiring co-ops students to give back to the programs that initially helped them. Also, they look for people who \"<strong>understand the problem</strong> <strong>they are trying to address and</strong> <strong>feel passionate about solving it</strong>\" through conferences and networking events, for instance.</p>\n<h2><strong>Inspiration to Go!</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are so many important problems out there that are not getting enough attention, especially in the social impact area.</p>\n<p>Those areas can still be profitable, and they need businesses and smart people to come in, work on those problems and build up those markets. It is an extremely fun and exciting journey, and I do not think you will regret it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-1-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-1-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-9-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-9-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-3-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-3-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/phot-8-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1163\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/phot-8-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"775\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-11-2.jpg\" data-size=\"899x1122\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-11-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"899\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-7-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1350\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-7-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"900\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your experience, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>With Laura Mather, Owner and Director at POW Hearing Solutions, we talked about supporting people with hearing loss and uncovered insights into adapting to the current macro shock.</p>\n\n<h2>About POW Hearing</h2>\n<p>Laura lost 25% of her hearing due to a noisy work environment, and it kept progressing over time. She explains that, for most people, \"it takes 7 to 12 years to start to move forward on helping yourself to hear better.\" Indeed, transitioning to their new situation takes a process that includes dealing with denial and finding a motivation to move forward.</p>\n<h3>Hearing Loss Can Affect Us All</h3>\n<p>Hearing loss can affect anyone, even people who do not go to a loud concert or experience a speaker's or an instrument's feedback, Laura says. Indeed, \"an extended sound exposure above 80 dB can [also] be harmful to your hearing\". <br>Also, she warns against prescribed and over-the-counter medication that can be ototoxic. \"In some cases, it can damage your hearing permanently.\"Â <br><br>People like Laura, who lose their hearing progressively, \"might gradually withdraw from situations that put [them] at a disadvantage\", without necessarily realising it. Often, \"[they] will pick up other ways of doing things [and] work around it\".</p>\n<h3>POW Hearing's Origin</h3>\n<p>During her post-secondary studies, Laura experienced first-hand the difficulties of following an event and interacting with a group of people in real time with impaired hearing. She had to put several systems in place to capture the ongoing events and conversations.</p>\n<p>After graduation, discrimination prevented Laura from working properly. It made her realise she could start her own business to support her community.</p>\n<p>She has, therefore, built upon the knowledge she acquired during her studies and life experiences to offer multiple fit-for-purpose easy-to-use devices and services related to hearing loss. \"If a business gets a request by somebody working with them to accommodate that person, to hear well at a live event with a large audience, for example, then they will come to [POW Hearing] to set that up for them.\" As a result, \"people feel respected and cared for\".Â </p>\n<p>Laura is currently looking for funds and support with marketing. In the future, she is hoping that existing players in the hearing loss space will join her in her journey to help people in different situations.</p>\n<h2>Insights Into Adapting to a New Macro Environment</h2>\n<p>With COVID, Laura had to reinvent herself as she could no longer offer her services during events.Â </p>\n<p>The key to adapting to a new macro context is to leverage your strengths vis-a-vis competition and rearrange your capabilities to avoid <strong>strategic drift</strong>. Usually, this drift occurs over a few years. A macro shock accelerates this phenomenon, and companies might have to adapt overnight.Â </p>\n<p>Laura probably saved her business by offering \"<span class=\"lt-line-clamp__raw-line\"><a href=\"https://powhearing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clear window lip reader face masks</a>\" to foster accessible communication and adapt to her new situation. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lt-line-clamp__raw-line\">Interestingly, these masks also have the side effect of enabling human interactions and facilitate communication, even for people with perfect hearing - which further increase the relevance of her solution.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people are lowering their masks. This is negating every safety features put in place! If I am crossing the street, wearing this mask, I have people stop me and say, where did you get that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<p>For someone who has hearing loss, Laura highlights that one size does not fit all. You can start by asking them what they need. \"I can give you a list, but it is not going to work,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Overall, if you look at how people can communicate with you, you should offer a way that does not involve them to hear. For instance, an email address instead of a phone number only.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who have hearing loss can do everything that people who do not have hearing loss can do, except they cannot hear!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your experience, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>With Marveh Farhoodi, Program Director at the Open Architecture Collaborative Canada (OACC), we uncovered insights into leveraging human-centred design for architectural and community projects.</p>\n\n<h2>About Open Architecture Collaborative Canada</h2>\n<p>OACC is a collaborative of socially-minded people with the mission to advocate for positive changes in the building of under-served communities' neighbourhoods in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>\n<p>For instance, OACC organised a community session to revisit the planning of a neighbourhood that was heavily impacted by gentrification. A motion has then been started to ensure that this neighbourhood's cultural identity will be preserved in the community.</p>\n<p>For the past one-and-a-half year, OACC have been transitioning from an exclusively volunteer-run organisation and project-based mindset to a mission-centric startup. In a couple of years, they are hoping to be a social hub to incubate ideas for more resilient cities and neighbourhoods in Canada.<br><br><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">OACC always welcome volunteers that are aligned with their purpose. They are also looking for funding and sponsoring. Finally, if you are interested in learning about what they do through their workshops, they would be more than happy to provide that service to you.</span></p>\n<h2>Insights Into Human-Centred Design</h2>\n<p>The human-centred design is an approach that OACC uses to understand social challenges. It is already commonly used in various industries, but not yet in this space.</p>\n<p>It tries to come to a collective solution by engaging with the people it will serve to understand their needs properly. They should be at the centre of creating and not just providing inputs.</p>\n<h3>The Five Steps of the Human-Centred Design</h3>\n<p>The human-centred design process contains five steps: Framing, Empathising, Synthesising, Concepting and Prototyping.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/hcd.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/responsive/hcd-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/responsive/hcd-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/responsive/hcd-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"752\" height=\"278\"></figure>\n<p>The two first steps are those involving primary and secondary data collection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Framing</strong> is about understanding the team's capacity based on the available resources as well as defining assets, budget and time. This step's inputs include the project's broad definition and secondary data.</li>\n<li><strong>Empathising</strong> is about collecting primary data and further learning from your context.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Collecting Data</h3>\n<p>To collect primary data, OACC uses one-on-one or small group interviews, while putting co-creation at the centre of their research. For instance, they organise community meetings and workshops to envision what they want to work on visually and creatively. These interactions provide insights into people's point of view and desires.</p>\n<p>OACC also uses surveys, focus groups, and collaboration between focus and research groups to go further.</p>\n<p>In summary, they leverage diverse techniques and tools based on live interactions between local stakeholders and specialists.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we do can create momentum for changes.

My name is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoy-stephen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Benoy Stephen</a>, and I play the sport called Ultimate Frisbee. I got introduced to the sport during my last undergrad year. Then, I got the chance to work with <a href=\"https://www.teachforindia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teach for India</a> for two years in a government school in Hyderabad, where we met with some wonderful kids and tried out a few things to support them using Ultimate Frisbee as a tool. In the process, I met <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekanand-srivastava-13b78751/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vivek Srivastava</a> and a few other peers who also had a passion for Ultimate Frisbee and wanted to help children through this sport. So, we all set up Y-Ultimate together and now, here we are.</p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: I used to sail on ships for 15 years before deciding that I wanted to do something else and went into business school. During my studies, I loved learning about Organisational Behaviour and became a research assistant in the field. One of my research's topics was ethics at the workplace, and that is how I came across Ultimate Frisbee. Then, I completely went into the sport and started playing full time.</p>\n<p>We are both members of our team and play with our kids. The youngest in our team is 15 years old, and the oldest is me, and I am over 40. We all work hard together!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the end of every Ultimate Frisbee game, a spirit circle takes place. It is a beautiful concept where you have both team members mixing up, coming together in a circle, and then resolving any conflict, giving feedback, appreciating each other so that everyone goes home with a clean slate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What is Ultimate Frisbee?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: Ultimate Frisbee is a non-contact self-refereed mixed-gender sport. It is played with a flying disc, and you could say it is a mixture of basketball and American football.</p>\n<p>Unlike many sports, you have to self-officiate and uphold the rules as a result. This constitutes the fundamentalÂ principle on which Ultimate runs, and it is called the spirit of the game (SOTG). You do not use any mind games and always have to remain respectful while playing.Â </p>\n<p>Ultimate Frisbee is not that well-known in India (we have about 10,000 people playing), but we use it as a tool for kids' development.</p>\n<p><em>Benoy</em>: Also, at the end of every Ultimate Frisbee game, a spirit circle takes place. It is a beautiful concept where you have both team members mixing up, coming together in a circle, and then resolving any conflict, giving feedback, appreciating each other so that everyone goes home with a clean slate. It is a space for reflection built into the sport that constitutes an excellent tool for learning.Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over time, the main drivers that we had were the changes that we saw in those kids' lives and the results that we noticed in the field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What were your drivers and motivations to start the organisation?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek:Â </em>In the heart of Delhi, we came across a small community that was economically challenged. The children from this community would come, watch us play and become enthusiastic about it. They wanted to play, and we pulled them in with us. We quickly saw their potential: they were very athletic and picked up the sport very fast. They were exceptional! We started to ask ourselves how we could help them to let them play more. Indeed, no support is available for this sport in India, and you need shoes, gear and money to play in tournaments.</p>\n<p>In 2015, we started to help a small group of kids from that community (between 10 to 15 years old), and they just kept getting better. We were encouraged by how they were growing, so we did not want to remove our financial support. However, we thought that we needed to develop further this project to sustain it.</p>\n<p>We got donations from family and friends as a first step. Then, inspired by the positive changes that we saw in these children, we thought about registering ourselves as an organisation to support even more children in India. All along, our biggest motivation has been those kids.</p>\n<p><em>Benoy: </em>We did not start off thinking that we wanted to become an organisation but rather as a group of friends who met on the Ultimate Frisbee field and thought about supporting the children who were playing and could play the sport. Over time, the main drivers that we had were the changes that we saw in those kids' lives and the results that we noticed in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you reach out to more children? Do you have partnerships with schools or, do you use other channels?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: The young kids that we met in Delhi have grown so much as players and individuals. So, we decided to mentor them into becoming our young coaches to help us reach out to more children.</p>\n<p>We have three models to do so. One is through schools: we have both an in-school program and an after-school program - depending on what works best for each school. We also do a community program where we immerse ourselves in a community with the support of a partner organisation and other groups or individuals. Finally, we help other organisations set up their Ultimate Frisbee program, where our youth coaches go, build capacity, and then leave and support them remotely.Â <br><br><strong>You mentioned you needed funds to pay for the gear and tournaments, for instance. Do you generate revenues to sustain your purpose?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: Most of our revenue comes from donations, and we have individuals who donate to us for a particular community. So, whatever contribution we get goes entirely to the youth coach that is handling that community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many communities want engagement for recreational purposes, but also some communities start aspiring to take the sport more seriously. We are always happy to support them no matter how far they want to go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>How long do you work with a certain group of children?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: The kids we met in Delhi always stay with us and have become our youth coaches, and we plan to stay together. Otherwise, we conduct one-time workshops in communities and schools and continuous coaching programs that last a year or more - depending on the funding, players' availability, community issues, and more.<br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, the youth coaches constitute an essential part of our organisation, and we are all able to teach people right from the beginning (basic level and up). So, it will just depend on the aspirational level of the children. Many communities and NGOs want engagement for recreational purposes, but also some communities start aspiring to take the sport more seriously. We are always happy to support them no matter how far they want to go.</p>\n<p><strong>It is great to hear about what you have been doing as you are working with children from economically disadvantaged communities and providing them with a sense of community and purpose. I think you are fostering many social and emotional skills such as collaboration, inclusiveness, humility, responsibility and resilience among these children!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, and you know, our children regularly get selected for the Indian national team. Two of our girls have already represented India at an international level. In 2020, we had four of our girls who got selected for an Under-20 (U20) team for India. Unfortunately, the tournament got cancelled because of COVID-19, but that is how good our children are. I also got the chance to play a tournament in France while representing India, and we won the Spirit of the Game Award.<br><br><strong>That is awesome, congratulations guys! I saw you have been to several states in India. So, how many children have you worked with so far?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy:</em>Â  We have worked with more than 1200 children in one year so far.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of our girls wants to grow up to implement policy changes to allow for more gender equality and tackle other issues that she has seen in her village. Others want to become lawyers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Overall, what effects have you seen in their lives as a result of your initiatives?</strong><br><br><em>Vivek</em>: The community in Delhi, previously mentioned, has around 500 children, and we work with 30 of them. So, if you look at their peers, they tend to drop out of school as they do not have the correct support system to help them make the right decisions for their future.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, most of our team's children are doing well in school and have future goals. For instance, one of our girls wants to grow up to implement policy changes to allow for more gender equality and tackle other issues that she has seen in her village. Others want to become lawyers.</p>\n<p>All of this has been very organic - and we think it is related to the nature of the sport. Indeed, Ultimate is an inclusive sport where both genders play together. So, all of our kids have forgotten gender stereotypes. Also, they do not pick up on their peers' bad habits such as smoking and drinking as it is not enough to be gifted to succeed in this sport - you have to put in the effort and discipline to get results.</p>\n<p>So, we have noticed changes in their attitudes such as resilience, discipline, ownership, positivism and inclusiveness; and it is so nice to see what they are now doing with their lives. These changes have kept us going.</p>\n<p><strong>Sports are so powerful. In this case, it is fantastic to see the wide range of effects that it has had in these children's lives. It is also great to hear that they have started to pay more attention to their health to get better at the sport.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: Yes! One of our kids stopped smoking because he realised that it was vital if he wanted to improve. He just came to that conclusion himself and stopped smoking!</p>\n<p><strong>Let's talk more about your journey to become an organisation. Was there anything crucial to make it happen?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: I would say something crucial was constantly seeing our team winning tournaments and the Spirit of the Game Award, calculated based on opponents' rates. So, playing at the highest level of spirit and winning as a result of performing at our best were components that made us keep moving forward.Â </p>\n<p><strong>What have been your biggest challenges?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy: </em>Even though the International Olympic Committee recognised the sport, our country does not recognise it. So, when you pitch the sport in a school or community, you get asked questions as \"Can I make a career out of this?\" \"Will I get a certificate that is going to help me with a job or an admission somewhere?\" Sadly, the answer to those questions is \"not yet\". So, we have to let them see the potential the sport has and ask them to give us a chance to show them.<br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Another challenge is funding to take care of our coaches, the costs of travel, the gear and other expenses. We also need to cover the financial incentives we have in place for our kids who teach and coach other children via our paid-forward model. In this model, we try to cross-subsidise our initiatives. For instance, we take the money earned from going to a school, which generally can pay us a session and use it to work with socially and economically underprivileged communities. However, as schools do not know well about Ultimate and it is not a well-recognised sport in India, it becomes challenging to sustain our model.</p>\n<p><strong>What effects has the pandemic had on your work, and how have you adapted so far?</strong><br><br><em>Vivek</em>: We have not been able to play since March last year. Meanwhile, we have expanded our team and reached out to people who can help us market ourselves and translate what we are trying to say in better ways. They do not play, but they believe in what we are doing. We will see their work's effects when everything reopens.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, we have been doing a lot of jump rope exercises to stay fit during the lockdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, what can we do to support your organisation?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: Donations are welcome because there are constantly a few communities that would like our service pro bono. Also, we are always looking for like-minded people with different skill sets than ours to help us do things better and figure out how to take this best forward. Finally, we look for volunteers to capture our games' greatest moments to communicate about what we are doing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is rare to have both high performance and spirit in a team. In India, the teams that generally win have traditionally not been high on spirit scores. We managed to keep our kids competitive without them becoming aggressive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What do you feel have been your greatest achievements?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: Winning a tournament while having a highly-rated spirit performance is a great achievement for us. Also, we love it when a community reaches out to us to start playing.<br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, I agree. Indeed, it is rare to have both high performance and spirit in a team. In India, the teams that generally win have traditionally not been high on spirit scores. We managed to keep our kids competitive without them becoming aggressive. I do not know how we did it, but it is one of our most outstanding achievements!<br><br><strong>I am aligned with that approach. I believe it is good to seek excellence, but never at the expense of other people.Â </strong><br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, exactly! The only person we have to beat is ourselves. You can see this mindset in our videos about our jump-rope workouts. You can notice a huge difference between the beginning and eight months later: this reflects their mentality and how they want to achieve mastery and excellence in what they are doing.<br><br><em>Benoy: </em>Yes, it is noticeable, and it gives me a lot of joy. When I started playing in 2015, I played against a team with smaller kids, so it was easy to throw the Frisbee above their heads, and we ended up winning the game. However, they worked on themselves, learned from their defeats, and never gave up, and now the tables have turned completely: they are one of the best teams in the country at this point.Â <br><br><strong>What do you envision for the years to come?</strong><br><em>Vivek</em>: Our mission is to spread out Ultimate Frisbee to as many children as possible.Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To everyone, come and play!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Would you like to share anything else with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Benoy</em>: Try Ultimate Frisbee! If you want to start anywhere in India, reach out to us on our social media platforms, and we will get back to you and support you with whatever you need, even tools to help you build your community to reach out to more children.Â </p>\n<p>If you are an educator, I would like to share how sports are a great tool to teach children how to accept, recover and learn from a failure. Indeed, even if you put your best foot forward in sports, things might not go as planned.<br><br>To everyone, come and play!</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-3-with-frisbees.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-3-with-frisbees-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/in-motion.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x607\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/in-motion-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/frisbees-gk-mad.jpg\" data-size=\"1992x1121\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/frisbees-gk-mad-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-1.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-3.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-4.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x565\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/solidarity.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/solidarity-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/spirit-circle.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x565\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/spirit-circle-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/strategy.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/strategy-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/team-spirit.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x565\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/team-spirit-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post.

My name is Aisha, and I am the founder of an organisation called Power to Girls. We provide leadership, personal development, mental health, and entrepreneurship training to support Black and marginalised girls. We have been doing this for the past eight years, and I care deeply about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell me more about the activities that you do to support these young girls?</strong><br><br>Yes, absolutely. We have a partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.tcdsb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toronto Catholic District School Board</a> to deliver our programs within the schools.</p>\n<p>We focus mainly on girls in middle school (6th to 8th grades) and essentially run programs and workshops that highlight and address our four main pillars: mental health, leadership, mentorship, and entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>We ensure that the girls have a space that allows them to be themselves, pick up on all these programs, and become whomever they want to become in the future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The system that had been assigned to me did not necessarily expect much of me. [...] I remember saying to myself, <em>\"I'm not going to be a stereotype!\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What were your drivers and motivation to start the foundation?</strong></p>\n<p>I came to Canada as an immigrant, and my first experience was in high school. I was going through my teenage years and could not find a space that allowed me to tap into the questions I had as a source of empowerment. Seeing that Black girls did not have places to express themselves was the first key motivator to start Power to Girls.</p>\n<p>Everything shifted when I ended up in foster care (from 15 to 18 years old). I remember my foster mom having a conversation with me and explaining that the system assigned to me did not necessarily expect much of me. I was expected to either become a teenage mom, dropout, drug addict, etc.Â </p>\n<p>I remember saying to myself, <em>\"I'm not going to be a stereotype!\"</em>.</p>\n<p>These two experiences, coupled with other ones, became the driving forces for Power to Girls, as I realised that even girls who might not necessarily find themselves in foster care still need inspiration sources and have those moments of questioning about who they are.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The girls that participate in our programs always end up coming back as mentors or facilitators. [...] Once you have joined Power to Girls, you are part of the Power to Girls family.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Can a young girl get support after the middle-school programs?</strong></p>\n<p>We focus on young girls in middle school, but we still support them later on when they get into high school, for instance.</p>\n<p>In the next couple of months, we are launching My Power App, an application that focuses specifically on connecting girls to mentors and providing support.</p>\n<p>So, we are proud of the beautiful cycle it becomes. Indeed, the girls that participate in our programs always end up coming back as mentors or facilitators. The majority of our facilitators are girls that have participated in our program in the past. Once you have joined Power to Girls, you are part of the Power to Girls family.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">We have witnessed changes in their communication style and self-confidence. We [have also seen] them being comfortable and beautiful in their own body and feeling confident enough to speak up when something does not feel right for them.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What effects have you noticed in these girls' lives as a result of your initiatives?</strong><br><br>This question is always very interesting because our programs focus on self-reflection and personal development.</p>\n<p>It is always beautiful to notice the changes within our girls. We have programs where some people are super quiet initially, but, getting closer to the end of the programs, they become more comfortable in who they are and expressive. Also, <span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">we have had girls that have started their businesses in one of our entrepreneurship programs, a</span><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">nd we have seen them get the confidence to share and talk about their businesses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">So, we have witnessed changes in their communication style and self-confidence. We have also seen them being comfortable and beautiful in their own body and feeling confident enough to speak up when something does not feel right for them.</span></p>\n<p><strong>I think you provide these girls with a holistic support system that includes a set of complementary tools that let them blossom. I believe it helps them today, and it will also open opportunities for them in the future. Also, it is great to see that they are able to support other girls later on as well.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We did not get here overnight. It was something that we worked hard to accomplish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Let's talk more about your journey as a social entrepreneur. What steps did you take to create the foundation, and how long did it take to kick start it?</strong><br><br>Yes, that is an excellent question. I started Power to Girls when I was in college. So, it started based on my passion for not having girls experience some of the things I did in Canada and society.</p>\n<p>Then, I realised that I wanted to turn it into more than a passion down the road. So, I wondered, how do I turn this passion into purpose? And, How can I turn it into something that is beyond me and would strive even when I am not around? The journey has not been easy as you have to find the right people, support, and other things related to the entrepreneurial journey itself.</p>\n<p>Currently, we have three full-time staff, 15 facilitators that we can always count on, and mentors. We also have folks who want to be part of our organisation. We provide them with training, then they go back and provide training themselves. So, we are now running an amazing oiled machine that not only provides employment but also support.</p>\n<p>I am recognising the magnitude of what we are doing now that I am speaking to you! It has been a process, and we did not get here overnight. It was something that we worked hard to accomplish.</p>\n<p>I can also share this because I have got some great people who believe in our vision. I think it is crucial to work with people smarter than you and actually care about what you are working on, as it generates a sense of ownership.<br><br><strong>It is rare to see anything happen overnight. It is a good thing to work on something that you care about to enjoy the effort you will have to put on. Even for the people who appear to have succeeded overnight, it usually involves many experiences, maybe some failures, a lot of work, etc.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So, what have been your biggest challenges at the different stages of your journey?</strong><br><br>It has been challenging to access capital. When the need arises, I do not mind taking it out of my pocket because I deeply care about it.Â </p>\n<p>Otherwise, since I originally studied Accounting in school, and social work was not my first choice, accessing the resources, skills and support that would allow us to scale the organisation is also challenging.<br><br><strong>How have you been tackling these challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a matter of networking and trying to find different opportunities for us to build partnerships. Also, we have been applying for more grants.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, having the platform that we are currently creating is also allowing us to automate things.</p>\n<p>Finally, we look for people who will become champions of the organisation and support us throughout our journey and growth. We are grateful for the partners we have now and the ones to come.<br><br><strong>What is the status of your organisation? Do you generate revenues to sustain your purpose?</strong><br><br>We are a not-for-profit organisation registered in Canada and Ghana. We do generate revenues from the sale of our merchandise, which are funnelled back into the organisation.<br><br><strong>How has the pandemic affected your work, and how have you adapted so far?</strong><br><br>We are closely tied to the school and education system. Whatever happens to the school system indirectly happens to us.

Through Sahithya's journey, we share insights into how to tackle some frequent social entrepreneurship challenges.</p>\n\n<p>The Inqui-Lab Foundation started in 2017 and has recently moved from impacting the lives of 3,000 to 23,000 children through a program called the <a href=\"https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/copy-2-of-program\">School Innovation Challenge</a>, in partnership with UNICEF, the <a href=\"https://www.teamtsic.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Telangana State Innovation Cell</a>, the Education Department of Telangana and volunteering makers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We started the organisation, and we are running it, but we always ask ourselves on a yearly and monthly basis whether we have the skills required for the next stage or current stage of our organisation. We constantly think about what we need to plug the gaps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sahithya and her co-founders Eshwar Bandi and Vivek Piddempally knew each other for less than a year before they launched the foundation. They readily established a shared vision through discovery and communication. However, growing their skills as social entrepreneurs required mentorship, time, and peer feedback, to understand what it means and shift from a project to an organisation.</p>\n<p>Today, I would consider her a <a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/what-is-a-social-entrepreneur.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social entrepreneur</a> since her foundation is a nonprofit, generating revenues through workshops and other activities to grow its operations. They are primarily focused on impacting the lives of students from economically disadvantaged places at a large scale while ensuring a sustainable business.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every six months came with its challenges. It was either a primary skill gap or being unhappy about the program's progress. I pick a battle every month or every three months, but I also proactively try to find solutions and see how to surpass them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Social entrepreneurship comes with its challenges, often unrelated to a social cause. In this case, Sahithya mainly highlighted challenges revolving around personal development, establishing boundaries to work, thinking about the big picture and scaling. None of which are directly linked to their purpose.</p>\n<p>Struggling with boundaries between work and personal life is something that often comes up for entrepreneurs. We tend to have difficulties determining when to stop working and forget to take care of ourselves during the process, sometimes leading to burnout or less effective and efficient work. If we forget ourselves, I would say it is essential to take it easy and move on.</p>\n<p>Also, I have noticed several women entrepreneurs talk about their need for accomplishing too much too fast. Sahithya mentioned her impatience vis-<span class=\"ILfuVd\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">Ã </span></span>-vis her learning curve or how rapidly the Inqui-Lab Foundation was growing.Â </p>\n<p>To overcome these challenges, she highlighted two main takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proactively talking to other people brings you perspective and insights that can help you along the way <span class=\"nounderlines\">â even though it can be difficult when you are introverted, it is worthwhile</span>.Â </li>\n<li>Getting time to exercise, meditate, read and build skills energises you by taking a step back and establishes boundaries to work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contextually, Sahithya also recognises that it has been difficult to learn from organisations in India that are doing similar work unless they are partners <span class=\"nounderlines\">â even though they share the same goals</span>. She even mentioned wondering what each of her project's unique value was after talking to some of her peers. This feeling is also something that many entrepreneurs seem to experience. With time, Sahithya has seen the value in establishing partnerships by witnessing first-hand the power of Inqui-Lab's collaborations with <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UNICEF</a>, <a href=\"https://unleash.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UNLEASH</a>, and other organisations.</p>\n<p>In this regard, we should ask ourselves whether a partnership could exist and how could it lead to accomplishing greater outcomes while keeping in mind the end goal: having more impact, offering something unique, sharing resources, learning from each other, etc.Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During the pandemic, we spent around a quarter helping other organisations around food programs, donations, etc., which was not necessarily directly aligned to problem solving or working with children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though COVID-19 impacted Inqui-Lab's operations, they quickly thought about delivering their programs to students in a different way. They did multiple experiments and ended up designing the previously mentioned School Innovation Challenge with UNICEF.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This project was a turning point for us, but as many children do not have access to the internet, we still have to figure out how to reach them best.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Macro shocks tend to accelerate something that was already going to happen by constantly pushing you to adapt through innovation. In times like this, I think it is important to have a high-level perspective to understand the situation and its implications and imagine what steps we should take to blossom. Often, as for this instance, opportunities emerge in these uncertain times <span class=\"nounderlines\">â </span>where the cards have been reshuffled for everyone and where we need to think differently.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post.

I'm from India, a state called Telangana and city, Hyderabad. I have been in education since 2014, starting with a <a href=\"https://www.teachforindia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teach for India</a> fellowship <span class=\"nounderlines\">â which </span>was my first 101 in education and public schools. Right after, we co-founded Inqui-Lab Foundation in 2017 with two of my colleagues from Teach for India: Eshwar Bandi and Vivek Piddempally.</p>\n<p>For the last three years, we have been running this organisation. Our vision is to nurture problem-solving skills in children. I am very excited about this conversation and looking forward to sharing more about what we do!<br><br><strong>Where do the students come from? Do you have partnerships with schools? Or, can any student reach out to your organisation?</strong></p>\n<p>As an organisation, we have decided to work with public school students from socially economically disadvantaged communities. So, with that mission in mind, we operate a lot with the public school system. We also keep in mind that we want to scale all the interventions we design through this system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We witnessed students observing problems, coming up with creative ideas, and excited to test these ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>How do you foster student innovation?</strong><br><br>Our organisation was started by us witnessing the kind of ideas that students were coming up with within our classrooms! For example, a student had said, <em>'my mother wakes up many times in the night because she has to rock my sister's cradle, and I want to make a cradle that automatically rocks as soon as my sister cries'</em>. So, we witnessed students observing problems, coming up with creative ideas, and were excited to test these ideas.</p>\n<p>From that starting point where we saw potential, we then started looking at how best to equip students to innovate. That is where we segwayed into the design thinking process, for example. We thought about how we could teach design thinking to children between the age group of 10 to 15. How can we simplify the process for them? And, how can we teach it at scale in schools? So, we started researching and designing around these questions.<br><br><strong>Can you tell me more about how you use design thinking?</strong><br><br>We see it as a process for problem solving and have crafted our own four-step process to use it: find and understand a problem, ideate to solve it, make and test (step where you iterate on your ideas) and present. The last point consists of sharing your ideas with a larger group. This four-step process is inspired by what we learned through our research on design thinking and local and global education for children, including at Stanford.Â <br><br>Design thinking is meant to be user-driven. So, you get feedback from users and iterate on your ideas. Keeping that in mind, we try to ensure that, within our program, students are not just thinking about building an end product, but the process and takeaways that they get through it are equally important.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The School Innovation Challenge was done in partnership with UNICEF [...]. We went from working with 3,000 students to 23,000 students by establishing multiple partnerships.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>You mentioned that prototyping is an integral part of your four-step process. So, many of your students' ideas come to life through a prototype. Do you produce these prototypes at scale?</strong><br><br>For us, scaling is at a program level. We have two flagship programs that we run for students.</p>\n<p>One is called <a href=\"https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/copy-of-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Think &amp; Make</a>. It is an in-school program, a weekly intervention, meant for grades 8th and 9th. Through the two years, students do multiple units of innovation. In every unit, they come up with an idea and a prototype. What we scale right now is the intervention itself. We are currently reaching two schools; how could we take it to 5, 10, 25, 200, 5000 schools throughout the state? For the prototypes themselves, we are looking at multiple opportunities right now. They are currently making them in the classrooms and presenting them to their peers during the programs. However, we are exploring whether a great student idea can get further opportunities. Can it be implemented, mentored, funded?Â <br><br>The second program is called the <a href=\"https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/copy-2-of-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School Innovation Challenge</a>. We are running it as a result of COVID-19. It consists of online and in-school interventions where we codify a three-hour problem-solving course. During this course, students learn the basics of design thinking and problem solving. Then, they do a capstone project that they submit to us. This School Innovation Challenge was done in partnership with UNICEF and brought a lot of learnings for us. For example, we went from working with 3,000 students to 23,000 students by establishing multiple partnerships. So, we understood what scaling means. This program was a highlight for us!<br><br><strong>Congratulations! Can you tell me more about these partnerships?</strong><br><br>I cannot imagine Inqui-Lab or any of our work without partnerships. For our School Innovation Challenge program, we had four main ones.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning, we collaborated with the <a href=\"https://www.teamtsic.org/\">Telangana State Innovation Cell</a>, a centre in our state whose mission is to encourage innovation at the school, college and corporate levels.</p>\n<p>UNICEF trusted us with the program design and also funded its development. We also partnered with the Telangana State Education Department of our state, who were willing to roll this out to 5,000 schools during the COVID time. We trained around 5,000 teachers, which then helped us take this program to the 23,000 students. Â </p>\n<p>The fourth partnership I would like to highlight is with makers. The top 25 ideas received mentorship and prototyping support from individuals working in NGOs who came forward and helped us. So, there is a lot of volunteering as well, a significant partnership component that we would like to explore. So, we had partnerships at every step of the program: funding, program design, implementation, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We started developing our kit, which has electronics, hand tools, [...] and other materials. This is the part that kids are so excited about. They are always looking forward to the prototyping sessions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Where do you source the materials and tools necessary for the prototyping?</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of materials, we are exploring two ways. For some of our programs, we did have a partnership with another for-profit company that also builds kits. They have electronics that they donated to us.</p>\n<p>However, we also started developing our kit, which has electronics, hand tools, small drill bits, small saws, wood, and other materials that they can use in their prototypes. This is the part that kids are so excited about. They are always looking forward to the prototyping sessions.</p>\n<p>The main reason we started in-house design is because of the cost factor. No partnership could offer us the cost that we were aiming for the kit. We do not have a manufacturing unit; right now, it is very manualÂ and human-resource intensive. The largest kit number that we have manufactured is 300, but we will have to look at how we can ramp up our manufacturing process if we want to scale up programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you rely solely on donations, or do you have other sources of revenues?</strong></p>\n<p>From day one, we have been lucky enough to be able to diversify our fundraising. 85% of our operations depend on donors' funding, and 15% is raised through revenue via other activities, like workshops. Certain organisations were willing to pay us for the programs or kits that we delivered for their schools.</p>\n<p>In terms of our sources, we have crowdfunding, companies' donations (i.e. CSR), grants, high-net-worth individuals donations, and incubators. Every year we have had either a grant or incubator to support us. Many incubators help organisations that are at an early stage (between zero to three years). So, they have been of significant help for us from day one because they also provided us with mentorship. My two co-founders have been instrumental in diversifying fundraising and ensuring that the organisation has the funds to run from year to year continuously.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today, we are a 15 to 20-member team [...]. We are learning the ropes around that, as the team is growing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>You are three partners. Do each of you has a specific role, or everyone does a little bit of everything?</strong></p>\n<p>It has changed year to year, but we have a major role that each of us plays âwithout having titles. For example, I focus on program design, curriculum design, etc. Vivek used to do a lot of the operations. Eshwar used to work on partnerships and fundraising. He speaks to a lot of people, brings in mentorship, and inputs from the external world.</p>\n<p>So, each of us have strategically taken on specific roles, but we had had all done everything as well â especially when we started (e.g. fundraising, program design, impact measurement, etc.). Today, we are a 15 to 20-member <a href=\"https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/team\">team</a>, and it has been an exciting journey for us. Indeed, it is not just the three of us now, so we need to have certain processes in place, a lot of project management, remote working â which has been a new challenge for us this year. So, we are learning the ropes around that as the team is growing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many of our mentors say that you are a different organisation at every stage, so if your staff gets more extensive, you will face other challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>How do you get from the starting point, usually a group of people who want to accomplish something together, to where you are now?</strong>Â <br><br>I can pinpoint two or three things. Many of our mentors say that you are a different organisation at every stage, so if your staff gets more extensive, you will face other challenges.Â <br><br>I can say that apart from your founding team, the following immediate people who join your team are vital. They need to be strong critical thinkers who are willing to question our vision and pivot our thinking in many ways. Indeed, as co-founders, we can get stuck on particular viewpoints. We were fortunate to get the right team at the very beginning. Every single person acted like co-founders themselves. They were able to bring initiative, ownership, and design to the organisation.</p>\n<p>Secondly, as the team was growing, we also started to take on more work. At this point, we have to get right the resourcing across projects and say no to certain things. We still struggle a bit in this area as we take on more than we can do, but we are trying to estimate better and ensure that the team is not taking on more than it can handle.</p>\n<p>The third is just learning and development. We are a young team (between 20 to 30 years of age). Some people are joining us for their first year of employment. So, we have a lot of responsibility to ensure that they have suitable role models and are getting the coaching they need â which we are learning in the process.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have to choose one thing â if possible â what would you say has been the most important point to pay attention to for the foundation to blossom?</strong></p>\n<p>I am going to keep the obvious finance fundraising aside because that is important. So, I would say a shared vision across all the team members.</p>\n<p>Even today, we spend time to ensure this, especially as we have three people leading. For example, we have to be clear about what student innovation means to each of us. When we say 'we want to nurture problem-solving skills, we need to know what problem-solving skills mean to us. Or, on a higher level, what does success mean for Inqui-Lab? Our common understanding of that is critical, and it applies to the rest of the team too.</p>\n<p>To be aligned on our vision, what we want to achieve, and our goals is essential to ensure everybody knows the most important thing to do when they get to the office every day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we hear stories like this, it is not just a success metric, but we see that students are beginning to believe that they can be partners in solving challenges around us.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What effects have you seen in the students' life as a result of your initiatives?</strong></p>\n<p>Students say that when they see a problem, they now know that they can think about an idea. I have also seen students implement their ideas. For example, Priyavarshini, as soon as COVID hit, had to go back to her village as schools were closed. As soon as she arrived, she made awareness posters, masks with gunny bags and distributed them in her community. When we hear stories like this, it is not just a success metric, but we see that students are beginning to believe that they can be partners in solving challenges around them.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/Priyavarshini.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Priyavarshini-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Priyavarshini-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Priyavarshini-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Priyavarshini\" width=\"355\" height=\"378\">\n<figcaption >Priyavarshini is an inspiring student who made awareness posters and masks with gunny bags and distributed them in her community.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Another example is Abhishek, whose idea was rated second best among the 7000 ideas we received in the School Innovation Challenge. He worked alongside Rajesh and Venu to conceive a low-cost wearable made with old fertiliser bags to ease farmers' work. It was produced and distributed to three families who helped test the idea. He told me that when he started interviewing people to understand the problems they were facing, he understood the world around him more. Also, he got to meet the high-level dignitaries in our state, which is rare. Finally, he said that his parents, who were farmers, were felicitated at his school for his team's innovation.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/Abhishek.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Abhishek-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Abhishek-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/6/responsive/Abhishek-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"425\">\n<figcaption >Abhishek and his team's low-cost wearable, made with old fertiliser bags, was rated second best in the School Innovation Challenge.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Otherwise, usually, the students who perform well academically are the ones who get highlighted, and everybody else is blurred out in the background, even from the teachers' perspective. In our specific classroom, we started to see that the students providing the best ideas were not necessarily the ones who were getting the highest marks. So, we were beginning to see these students also shine. They were getting recognised for their ideas and prototyping skills.</p>\n<p>Our programs must provide an inclusive and safe space for students. We also have a set of target skills and attitudes. When we talk about problem solving, it involves design thinking, teamwork, risk taking, innovative mindset âÂ which we measure during our programs as we consider them as impact.Â <br><br>To sum up, what brings me joy is when students believe in their ability to solve problems and value their ideas. They can then get recognition from others, and people around start to see students as partners. As an organisation, we celebrate that as a significant milestone.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your vision for the years to come, and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong><br><br>We have been designing for a while now. So, we will focus on scaling now. We are looking at how best to have partnerships and funding to scale.<br><br>As an organisation, we aim for a peer-led or student-led model â a highly scalable model. Also, we want the interventions to run without Inqui-Lab: let schools or communities run them. So, we think about incentivising them to run them and the ecosystem to support that.<br><br>Ultimately, we want to create an extensive network of young individuals who care about SDGs and are willing to do what it takes to build a better world.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people help you and support your organisation?</strong><br><br>One is just collaboration with organisations for program design. The second is funding for student ideas as well as schools that would like to run our programs. Finally, makers who have the skills to turn ideas into reality so that students can see the full value and impact of their innovations, helping them become social entrepreneurs in their own right.Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Next time, when you do see a problem, ask a child what he or she would do about it, and you would be surprised by what they say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Is there anything else that you would like to share?</strong><br><br>Next time, when you do see a problem, ask a child what he or she would do about it, and you would be surprised by what they say.

We employ at-risk and homeless youth in Toronto to handcraft fine jewellery. We pay them hourly wages and, on top of that, we return proceeds to support their individual goals such as funding, education, housing, courses, among others.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a tough time for me, and I thought about how challenging it must be for youth in vulnerable situations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;\">What motivated you to help at-risk and homeless youth in particular?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it was my journey. I had worked for a long time, and I went to school for music. So, I have always wanted to be creative. I could not finish my university degree because I had mental health challenges during my third year. So, when I came back, I struggled to find work.</p>\n<p>As I was recovering from mental illness, it was very challenging; I think the options were not there. Sometimes, you have a bad day, and it is not that you do not want to be helpful or happy, but you have a bad day. Looking back, I thought about how challenging it must be for youth in vulnerable situations. They grew up in environments where survival had to be their primary focus, and they might not have the wherewithal to get a degree or go to university. So, I wanted to create employment options that addressed that and helped them find purpose and success <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">differently</span>.<br><br><strong>I know that you set up programs to both further improve their lifestyle and reduce turnover. Can you tell me about these programs and their outcomes?</strong></p>\n<p>We have a couple of different things for proceeds to get back at work. There is a point system where youth are rewarded for creating healthy lifestyles. On top of that, we also have a mentorship program as we have many great customers in professional industries, always happy to volunteer their time, and often ask how they can be involved. So, if we have a youth who has a question about a specific industry that they can answer, we connect them. It helps our youth get answers and support in areas they need to get to where they want to go.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have youth who are already looking for ways to give back and support their community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What changes have you noticed in their lives as a result of working with you?Â </strong></p>\n<p>It has been incredible to see a variety of changes. Many of them say that they have never been able to hold on to a job as long as they have here. We have youth that thinks they would never want to leave because they love it, and it does not feel like work to them, which is so important. Also, when you are feeling unwell, your first instinct is to call in sick for everyone, but it has been amazing to see that our youth come to work and they leave saying, \"I am glad I came in today because I feel better having been here!\". That is such a great thing to hear!</p>\n<p>Also, it has been amazing to see that our youth want to pay it forward already. We have youth who are already looking for ways to give back and support their community. It is heartwarming to see because they come from a population that does not have much, and they are already giving back whatever they can. It motivates me to do what I do even more.</p>\n<p><strong>I love your organisation because it provides people with opportunities to learn, grow and gain independence. To me, Kind Karma is what social entrepreneurship is all about: a complete symbiosis between social impact and business.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learning to manage time, prioritise, find balance and have downtime was challenging [...] early on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Now, I would like to talk more about your journey as a social entrepreneur. Tell me, what have been the biggest challenges you have had at the different stages of your journey?</strong></p>\n<p>I think, as a social entrepreneur, it is challenging because there is no roadmap to entrepreneurship. You can have resources along the way, but it is a unique journey for everybody. Everyone has their challenges because everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>When I was starting, my biggest challenge was finding balance in my life. I am very much an overachiever, and I always needed to get things done immediately. I drove myself where I was piling on stuff. Ultimately, I would not get anything done because it was just too much for me to accomplish in one day. I would get overwhelmed and beat myself up about it. Learning to manage time, prioritise, find balance and have downtime was challenging. There were times where I felt terrible if I was not working and doing something for the business. It was easy for me to burn out and become not as good as possible because my mental health was not optimal. So, it was a challenge early on.</p>\n<p>And now, 2020 has been a crazy year. Learning how to navigate all these changes in how people do business and interact with each other has been a challenge. Also, get our mission and our journey out there without being able to do in-person events or meet people has been a very different challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>It can be difficult to balance work and life in general. When you are an entrepreneur, it is even more difficult because it is your own business, so you are even more involved. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>I agree with you. It is crucial to get some time for ourselves and make sure that we are taking care of our mental and physical health because if we are not doing great ourselves, we will not be able to do good for other people or make our business work. Right now, it has probably gotten more complicated because we are spending a lot of time at home.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 2020 [...] it was challenging because, for a lot of youth who do not have structure or do not even have optimal or healthy domestic environments, it is hard for them to stay focused and even be motivated to do things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I wanted to ask you, how has the pandemic impacted your operations? I remember you were using a co-working space at a university; has that changed?</strong><br><br></p>\n<p>That was one of our challenges, too, in 2020. We used to work at a small co-working space, and then it shut down.Â So, I was hardened for a while. I mailed supplies to youth to work at home. Still, it was challenging because many do not have structure or even have optimal or healthy domestic environments, and it is hard for them to stay focused and even be motivated to do things.</p>\n<p>Finally, at the end of last year, we got our own space, and we are excited to say that we will be moving again soon because we have already outgrown our space. It is a great problem to have, and we are excited about that. It has always been my dream to have a space where our youth can come in, be safe, have snacks, play games, things like that. We can save space for them to enjoy not only work but just life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is one big community; we are all in one world, we are all working together to make it a better place, and we should all support each other regardless of what we are doing and be kind to each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So, what have been your main takeaways during your journey while tackling these challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>I am just so happy to have found this social enterprise model. I remember when I first started, it was not something that we even mentioned. You would have either a nonprofit, which did good, or a business, which made money, and there was no merging of the two.</p>\n<p>It is incredible to see such a different mentality among social entrepreneurs. Some of my best friends are people who you would traditionally consider competitors, as they own jewellery companies as well. Still, we all know that everybody is doing their own good in the world, and it does not matter if they are selling a similar product. They are working and doing something that is also creating good change in the world. So, why can't we support each other? I love that mentality: it is one big community, we are all in one world, we are all working together to make it a better place, and we should all support each other regardless of what we are doing and be kind to each other.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowing that I have created a little bit of a difference in someone's life is the biggest achievement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What would you say are your biggest achievements as a social entrepreneur?</strong></p>\n<p>Just hearing our youth saying that they came in and felt better or have been able to stay here and work longer than they have in the past, that is an achievement. It means that I have created a safe and welcoming space.</p>\n<p>Those things mean more to me than anything physical or any accolades. Knowing that I have created a little bit of a difference in someone's life is the biggest achievement.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your vision for the years to come, and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong></p>\n<p>I have always wanted to help youth in major cities across the country. That is on the vision board. I always feel that, in big cities, at-risk and homeless youth always tend to fall through the cracks because they are one in millions of people, and there are only so many resources that can go around. So, I would love to have a Kind Karma office in major cities from coast to coast and hopefully make an impact there.</p>\n<p>Also, sometime in the future, maybe we will expand our offerings and do different things. I have always loved candles, so perhaps something like that. That is a brainstorming project now, but I would love to expand our country's footprint to help more youth.</p>\n<p><strong>What other challenges are you expecting in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>I think our next challenge might be to scale effectively. How do we make sure that, as we get bigger, everybody still has that small business feel? Or, how do we make sure that everybody still has that personal connection? Hopefully, we get bigger and get to scale, but I think every stage has its unique challenges, and I love that about it.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people support your organisation today?</strong></p>\n<p>They can visit our website <a href=\"https://kindkarma.ca/\">kindkarmaco.com</a> to learn more and, obviously, we love purchases, but even just a social media follow or share, anything like that, is always so appreciated. Our Instagram handle is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kindkarmaco/\">@kindkarmaco</a>. Our Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kindkarmaco\">facebook.com/kindkarmaco</a>. It does not always have to be monetary support. We also appreciate everybody sharing our story and our mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks so much for sharing your story! </strong><strong>I love seeing you and talking about Kind Karma. Is there anything else that you would like to share?</strong><br><br>I just want to say thank you to everyone who has supported us and who will take the time after this to look us up and read more about what we do. I cannot tell you, for us as a small business, how much that means, especially in a time where small businesses need it more than ever. So, thank you, and we appreciate it!</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-10.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-5.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-6.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-7.jpg\" data-size=\"661x465\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"661\" height=\"465\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-8.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-9.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-11.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-1.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-2.jpg\" data-size=\"774x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/5/gallery/image-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"893\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post.

I am an international development professional, and I have dedicated my career to eliminating poverty abroad. My work at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Gender_Equality_Canada\">Women and Gender Equality Canada</a>, helping with the COVID-19 response, made me wonder about the economic crisis that had accompanied the pandemic at home. So, I decided to use some of my expertise in the international development realm to help address this crisis right here at home. <span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">That is where the idea for the Toronto Local Currency came up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">When looking at how people deal with crises, I saw that local currency is a tool that is often used. It is not a new idea at all. Local currencies have been used since Mesopotamian times and were quite popular during the Great Depression. To this day, around 100 local currencies are operational around the world.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What effects are you expecting from this local currency?</strong></p>\n<p>The inspiration behind it is to get money to the people who need it most and make sure that it builds a community. In international development, we would call this a conditional cash transfer. In the case of Toronto Local Currency, the condition is that they spend it locally. So, the money stays in Toronto rather than making Jeff Bezos a richer man.</p>\n<p>Also, they must spend it on things that are going to improve their lives. So, there are some limitations (e.g. no lottery tickets, alcohol) to maximise impact, increase donor confidence in this vehicle and empower people. It is really about giving people the ability to make decisions for what they need the most.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We worked with a local artist to come up with symbolism that captures the history and spirit of Toronto and Canada more broadly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Is it a virtual currency, or do you print your own money?</strong></p>\n<p>Toronto Local Currency is a physical note. We have been considering a virtual platform with some partners, but it was vital for us to have this be a physical note to reduce the barriers to adoption. Some people are not tech savvy, and we did not want that to be a barrier to them participating.</p>\n<p>Also, we wanted to make sure it is secure and stable. A lot of online platforms can be hacked. By having a physical bill, you will eliminate some of that risk.</p>\n<p>Finally, we worked with a local artist to come up with symbolism that captures the history and spirit of Toronto and Canada more broadly. It is a beautiful-looking note that I think people will feel pride in using and want to buy, which is part of our revenue-generating and sustainability model.<br><br><strong>You mentioned that many local currencies exist worldwide. Actually, in my hometown in Lyon, France, we also have one (<a href=\"http://www.lagonette.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"la Gonette\"</a>). It supports the local economy and raises awareness about how currencies work. Did you get any insights from these other local currencies worldwide?Â </strong></p>\n<p>Yes, the inspiration was from currencies worldwide and historical usage. There was a local currency in Toronto, called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_dollar\">Toronto dollar</a>, that failed because of the way it was structured. Also, a virtual currency was highly speculative and tied into the Bunz trading platform that also similarly failed. I examined those economic models closely to determine where mistakes were made. Toronto Local Currency is structured differently to ensure that it would have more stability and not be speculative. Consumers and retailers will then feel confident and comfortable using it.<br><br><strong>What exactly happened with these other currencies in Canada?</strong></p>\n<p>The Toronto Dollar took a commission from retailers who accepted it and donated this commission to charity. However, losing a percentage of your revenue on each transaction adds up for a small business owner. While it is great that money went to charity, it did not inspire business owners to adopt the currency.</p>\n<p>We do not take any commission from our retailers and service providers who accept it. It is a way to inject liquidity into the Toronto market, inspire more spending locally and benefit local businesses the most.</p>\n<p>The virtual currency became far too speculative. Eventually, it was just too far removed from actual value to be real. So, the value proposition and economic model collapsed because there was no Canadian money to back the virtual one.</p>\n<p>Toronto Local Currency is different in that a Canadian dollar backs every TLC. People can be confident that every TLC does stand for a Canadian dollar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLC is a way of facilitating that cash transfer to people in need and adding a coolness factor for people who do not need help right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I saw that you are giving free TLC to people with lower income. How does this work, and how do you fund it?</strong></p>\n<p>TLC is funded by two main buckets of money. One is through donors and the other through consumers. Certainly, some people in Toronto would want to purchase TLC because it looks great, and it is a symbol of local investment and pride and a fantastic souvenir.</p>\n<p>People can buy it at an exchange rate of two to one (e.g. 20 Canadian dollars for 10 TLC). On the other hand, donors and sponsors would be donating regularly. Overall, TLC is a way of facilitating that cash transfer to people in need and adding a coolness factor for people who do not need help right now.<br><br><strong>I hope Torontonians will join you and embrace this currency!</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is time for young women and visible minorities to have authority, influence, and energy and share our creativity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Let's talk about your entrepreneurial journey. What are the biggest challenges that you have had so far?</strong></p>\n<p>Mostly, the challenges faced by most young women of colour: our credentials and abilities are questioned and examined much more harshly than our white male or even white female colleagues. I remember the first time I was starting a business seven years ago. I went to the bank to get a business account, and the man across the desk kept questioning me like he could not believe that a young woman of colour had started a business. I don't think that would have happened to someone who had looked different from myself in that position. I believe that it is time for young women and visible minorities to have authority, influence and energy, and share our creativity.<br><br><strong>How to tackle these challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>You cannot let the backwards thinking of a couple of people keep you from what you are meant to do. You look for allies, partners, strategic partnerships that are going to empower you. Not everyone is going to have confidence in you. Some people will question you - be prepared for that - but do not let it stand in your way. You might have the idea for the next big thing that could do a lot of good and change many people's lives for the better.<br><br><strong>Today, do you feel you have any challenges that you need help to overcome?</strong><br><br>We have had to do some strategic, large pivots. The project was supposed to have a much more exciting roll-out than is possible right now with the extreme lock-down in Ontario. As it is a physical currency, it requires people to go into shops, restaurants and grooming services. Also, some of our partnerships, like with various Christmas markets, had to be cancelled. So, right now, we have had to pivot to just expanding the network rather than getting the currency operational immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>I agree that we have to adapt and try to find other ways to make things happen.<br></strong><strong>Now, let's talk about the organisation itself. What is the status of your organisation?</strong></p>\n<p>Charitable status in Canada is fairly challenging to get and has quite a few restraints on what you can do, as well as burdensome administrative requirements. To increase our flexibility and allow this project to get off the ground early enough, we made the conscious decision to leave it as a social entrepreneurship vehicle rather than go for official charitable status.<br><br><strong>You mentioned donations earlier. Would you say you rely more on donations or people buying TLC?</strong><br><br>At this point, bearing in mind the market conditions, we rely more on donations. As the economy opens up again, I expect that will change.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We empower people to make their own best decisions and do it in a way that helps benefit the local economy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Overall, what would you say are your most significant achievements for this project?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say that the biggest achievement is mostly the impact that we have to empower people and give them dignity. If you provide someone with groceries that are not culturally relevant or provide a single mom with a bag of groceries when what she needs are diapers, you have helped them, but you have not solved their problems.</p>\n<p>Toronto Local Currency empowers people to solve the problems that are most pressing for them. We empower people to make their own best decisions and do it in a way that helps benefit the local economy.Â You have a two-fold benefit from one economic tool, and I think that is cool.<br><br><strong>What is your vision for the years to come, and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong></p>\n<p>We want to scale. Hopefully, this pandemic and the recession will end and we will be unnecessary. That is the thing about development projects: your greatest hope is always to put yourself out of business.</p>\n<p>I hope that for the next few years, TLC can become a widely used tool in Toronto and help people think more about their decisions when they are buying. I hope that this is going to be a project which inspires people to buy locally and consciously.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post.
