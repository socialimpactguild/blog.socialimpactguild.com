Also, she </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">educated herself on the problems and the related solutions to provide them to others.¬†</span></p>\n<p>In our discussion, we uncovered some tips to learn continuously while building and growing an organization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Managing time</strong>. Having a schedule and routine is essential to free time dedicated to learning. For instance, grouping meetings together can be useful to avoid context switching.</li>\n<li><strong>Collecting feedback</strong>. While talking with the people you want to help, you should take any opportunity to understand their biggest pain points and adapt your offer accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Leveraging tools and automation</strong>. Handling everything manually is not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, you should automate as much as possible, as soon as possible, to focus your energy on learning and performing other high-value tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Asking for help</strong>. You are not supposed to learn everything by yourself. W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hen a topic is outside your area of expertise, consider reaching out to people who can provide you with insights into the subject at hand.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Accepting mistakes</strong>. Mistakes happen, and you should not beat yourself up over them. The key is to learn from them and use these experiences to improve and make better decisions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Testing your ideas early</strong>. D<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on't wait for your product to be perfect. Instead, try to discard or validate your assumptions early on. The later you find out about a wrong assumption, the greater the cost.¬†</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Trusting the process</strong>. Growing an organization takes time. So be patient, appreciate what you are achieving, celebrate the victories - whatever their magnitude - and try to avoid frustration in the face of adversity.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at what you can give to people. It's not always money. It's not always your time. It's also your expertise, your knowledge. I believe everybody has something to give.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Hillary, only one year later, turned her frustration with the inaccessibility of built-in environments and the inability to participate in sustainability initiatives into a business opportunity.</p>\n<p>Her social enterprise intends to bridge the gap between sustainability and accessibility in the area of waste management. It provides organizations with WasteFinder, a shape-and-colour-based waste management system for public spaces, accessible to people of all¬†abilities.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/WasteFinder.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/responsive/WasteFinder-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"WasteFinder\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\">\n<figcaption >WasteFinder installed in a public space.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>STIL Solutions has already been working with 18 customers across Ontario, creating more inclusive spaces for people with vision loss, people living with blindness, young children who cannot yet read, or people who do not speak the language commonly used on signage. It also contributes to the standardization of waste management.</p>\n<p>The end goal is to \"empower everyone to be a steward of their environment and divert as much waste as possible from landfill.\" Hillary wants to make all public spaces accessible to people of all abilities from a sustainability perspective for the years to come.<br><br>To support STIL Solutions, follow them on Instagram and check out their website. You can also spread the word about their initiative and contact them if you want to implement their solution!</p>\n<h2 class=\"align-left\">Insights Into Turning Lack of Accessibility Into Business Opportunities</h2>\n<h3>Barrier Identification</h3>\n<p>It comes down to understanding the behaviours necessary for the cause you want to participate in (e.g. being more environmentally friendly) and asking yourself whether everyone can participate in that cause, regardless of their ability.</p>\n<p>By applying this approach to your context, you can turn barriers into business opportunities by removing them. \"It is important to recognize these gaps and act upon them,\" Hillary underlines.</p>\n<h3>Acknowledging Some Potential Challenges</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, technology might not always be the answer to your problem. For instance, Hillary wants to address the accessibility of built-in environments to participate in sustainability initiatives and did not want to \"place the responsibility of accessibility on the individual with the disability to have data on their phone and download an app.\"</p>\n<p>However, it can be more challenging to access funding without it. Also, when tapping into something innovative, it might become imperative to spend time and resources educating people to build credibility instead of focusing solely on growing. Moreover, very few women-led startups receive VC funding.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, it can be easy to burn out while running a low-tech social enterprise as a woman.</p>\n<h3>Ideas To Help You Thrive</h3>\n<p>We uncovered a set of factors that might help you thrive, despite the difficulties.</p>\n<p>First, it is crucial to understand that you need to <strong>enjoy the process</strong> and not only the end goal itself. So, make sure to put systems in place to enjoy your entrepreneurial journey and take care of yourself along the way.¬†</p>\n<p>Also, having a clear<strong> understanding </strong>of what you are trying to achieve is necessary to ensure your actions are always aligned with your objectives and avoid strategic drift.</p>\n<p>Finally, constant and ongoing <strong>communication</strong> with the community and stakeholders is essential. Hillary highlights that \"people with disabilities with diverse backgrounds and experiences\" informed all of her business decisions. She indicates this has allowed her to ensure her products will make a real impact. So, be always open to expanding your network and gathering feedback.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Disability is one of the only marginalized identities that we are all going to experience at some point in our lives because of injuries, temporary illnesses, age, among others. So, even if you think that this might not apply to you now, it is within everyone's best interest to make the environment more accessible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-1.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-3.png\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-3-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-4.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/22/gallery/image-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your story, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",

It also features relevant editorial content about how to live healthier and happier.</p>\n<p>\"The reality is that social isolation and loneliness is a global epidemic,\" Charlene says.

The idea is to understand the relevance of other potential revenue models and discover new revenue streams along the way. She highlights that you can only do so once you have built your product.</p>\n<p><strong>So,</strong> <strong>how to develop a relevant and robust first revenue model?</strong></p>\n<p>If possible, leverage your previous experiences and professional network to define the clientele that will help you keep the platform free.</p>\n<p>Charlene used her extensive marketing and editorial sales experience to develop partnerships with organisations that sponsor the content in her platform, helping her sustain Amintro. \"You need to know your clientele, understand their needs and pain points. [I realised that] I had a network of past clients who may benefit from what we are doing at Amintro,\" she explains.</p>\n<p>Amintro's partners include financial institutions, insurance companies, travel agencies, food manufacturers, among others, that provide services and products to support her target demographic. Note that these partnerships are also <strong>aligned</strong> with the company's purpose as they allow giving seniors access to valuable information for their mental and physical well-being.</p>\n<p>In terms of marketing, your positioning can significantly differ between your clientele and the people you want to support.</p>\n<p>To scale up your purpose and increase your impact, it might be necessary to consider fundraising. \"We have identified other opportunities for our stakeholders that will generate revenue, and we are [, therefore,] going into fundraising to build out our intellectual property and technology\".</p>\n<p>During the whole process, do not hesitate to look out for help in the areas that you do not know well, use the available resources, and build relationships with people who share your values.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have learned through all of this that people want to see you succeed and are generous with their knowledge and experience. They are very much willing and happy to answer your questions or to provide some form of assistance, whatever that may be. That is not something that I realised before starting the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your story, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",

These eye-opening experiences, notably in the Scandinavian countries, inspired them to use reverse logistics to create \"a solid process that would enable the reuse of packaging\".<br><br>Launched less than six months ago, amid the pandemic, A Friendlier Company has already rapidly expanded to support several Ontarian areas thanks to the support of the people who have \"rallied behind the foodservice businesses in [their] program,\" she says. As a result, Kayli explains they have reused \"over 5,000 containers that are equivalent to diverting 600 pounds of waste from landfill\".¬†<br><br>For the years to come, they keep in mind that they want to \"create a system for the average consumer and not just people who are [interested] in sustainability\" to broaden their impact.

It is not an easy journey! If you do not feel incredibly passionate about what you are doing, and if it does not give you the motivation to keep going, it is going to be tough.\", Kayli underlines.</p>\n<p>The idea is to make sure to \"choose a problem that<strong> needs </strong>solving,\" and you are willing to put the effort in to solve it.</p>\n<h3>First Steps</h3>\n<p>It is crucial always to be adaptable and <strong>resilient</strong>. A Friendlier Company faced two major obstacles at the beginning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Being constantly <strong>rejected</strong>; and</span></li>\n<li>Targeting large event venues and having to deal with COVID-19 (e.g. large unsold inventory).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, they <strong>adjusted quickly </strong>to the changes taking place in the market and \"built a system that would work during the pandemic\" and would tackle the ongoing increase in takeout waste. They also adopted an iterative and focused approach that helped them move forward.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Kayli highlights that \"every piece of [their] process was a big undertaking,\" and they leveraged their previous exposure to the startup world and experiences to design this process. According to her, other essential factors to the company's success include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applying to various programs;</li>\n<li><strong>Networking </strong>with as many people as possible; and</li>\n<li>Being willing to change your mind about your ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scaling-up</h3>\n<p>Raising equity enables growth and scaling up quickly to make a significant impact. A Friendlier Company won funding through programs first, then small equity fundraising and now they are contemplating opening up their pre-seed.</p>\n<p>They also work with a few groups from various universities (from engineering to marketing) and are hiring co-ops students to give back to the programs that initially helped them. Also, they look for people who \"<strong>understand the problem</strong> <strong>they are trying to address and</strong> <strong>feel passionate about solving it</strong>\" through conferences and networking events, for instance.</p>\n<h2><strong>Inspiration to Go!</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are so many important problems out there that are not getting enough attention, especially in the social impact area.</p>\n<p>Those areas can still be profitable, and they need businesses and smart people to come in, work on those problems and build up those markets. It is an extremely fun and exciting journey, and I do not think you will regret it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-1-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-1-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-9-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-9-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-3-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-3-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/phot-8-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1163\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/phot-8-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"775\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-11-2.jpg\" data-size=\"899x1122\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-11-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"899\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-7-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x1350\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/14/gallery/photo-7-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"900\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your story, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>With Laura Mather, Owner and Director at POW Hearing Solutions, we talked about supporting people with hearing loss and uncovered insights into adapting to the current macro shock.</p>\n\n<h2>About POW Hearing</h2>\n<p>Laura lost 25% of her hearing due to a noisy work environment, and it kept progressing over time. She explains that, for most people, \"it takes 7 to 12 years to start to move forward on helping yourself to hear better.\" Indeed, transitioning to their new situation takes a process that includes dealing with denial and finding a motivation to move forward.</p>\n<h3>Hearing Loss Can Affect Us All</h3>\n<p>Hearing loss can affect anyone, even people who do not go to a loud concert or experience a speaker's or an instrument's feedback, Laura says. Indeed, \"an extended sound exposure above 80 dB can [also] be harmful to your hearing\". <br>Also, she warns against prescribed and over-the-counter medication that can be ototoxic. \"In some cases, it can damage your hearing permanently.\"¬†<br><br>People like Laura, who lose their hearing progressively, \"might gradually withdraw from situations that put [them] at a disadvantage\", without necessarily realising it. Often, \"[they] will pick up other ways of doing things [and] work around it\".</p>\n<h3>POW Hearing's Origin</h3>\n<p>During her post-secondary studies, Laura experienced first-hand the difficulties of following an event and interacting with a group of people in real time with impaired hearing. She had to put several systems in place to capture the ongoing events and conversations.</p>\n<p>After graduation, discrimination prevented Laura from working properly. It made her realise she could start her own business to support her community.</p>\n<p>She has, therefore, built upon the knowledge she acquired during her studies and life experiences to offer multiple fit-for-purpose easy-to-use devices and services related to hearing loss. \"If a business gets a request by somebody working with them to accommodate that person, to hear well at a live event with a large audience, for example, then they will come to [POW Hearing] to set that up for them.\" As a result, \"people feel respected and cared for\".¬†</p>\n<p>Laura is currently looking for funds and support with marketing. In the future, she is hoping that existing players in the hearing loss space will join her in her journey to help people in different situations.</p>\n<h2>Insights Into Adapting to a New Macro Environment</h2>\n<p>With COVID, Laura had to reinvent herself as she could no longer offer her services during events.¬†</p>\n<p>The key to adapting to a new macro context is to leverage your strengths vis-a-vis competition and rearrange your capabilities to avoid <strong>strategic drift</strong>. Usually, this drift occurs over a few years. A macro shock accelerates this phenomenon, and companies might have to adapt overnight.¬†</p>\n<p>Laura probably saved her business by offering \"<span class=\"lt-line-clamp__raw-line\"><a href=\"https://powhearing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clear window lip reader face masks</a>\" to foster accessible communication and adapt to her new situation. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lt-line-clamp__raw-line\">Interestingly, these masks also have the side effect of enabling human interactions and facilitate communication, even for people with perfect hearing - which further increase the relevance of her solution.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people are lowering their masks. This is negating every safety features put in place! If I am crossing the street, wearing this mask, I have people stop me and say, where did you get that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<p>For someone who has hearing loss, Laura highlights that one size does not fit all. You can start by asking them what they need. \"I can give you a list, but it is not going to work,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Overall, if you look at how people can communicate with you, you should offer a way that does not involve them to hear. For instance, an email address instead of a phone number only.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who have hearing loss can do everything that people who do not have hearing loss can do, except they cannot hear!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your story, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>With Marveh Farhoodi, Program Director at the Open Architecture Collaborative Canada (OACC), we uncovered insights into leveraging human-centred design for architectural and community projects.</p>\n\n<h2>About Open Architecture Collaborative Canada</h2>\n<p>OACC is a collaborative of socially-minded people with the mission to advocate for positive changes in the building of under-served communities' neighbourhoods in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>\n<p>For instance, OACC organised a community session to revisit the planning of a neighbourhood that was heavily impacted by gentrification. A motion has then been started to ensure that this neighbourhood's cultural identity will be preserved in the community.</p>\n<p>For the past one-and-a-half year, OACC have been transitioning from an exclusively volunteer-run organisation and project-based mindset to a mission-centric startup. In a couple of years, they are hoping to be a social hub to incubate ideas for more resilient cities and neighbourhoods in Canada.<br><br><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">OACC always welcome volunteers that are aligned with their purpose. They are also looking for funding and sponsoring. Finally, if you are interested in learning about what they do through their workshops, they would be more than happy to provide that service to you.</span></p>\n<h2>Insights Into Human-Centred Design</h2>\n<p>The human-centred design is an approach that OACC uses to understand social challenges. It is already commonly used in various industries, but not yet in this space.</p>\n<p>It tries to come to a collective solution by engaging with the people it will serve to understand their needs properly. They should be at the centre of creating and not just providing inputs.</p>\n<h3>The Five Steps of the Human-Centred Design</h3>\n<p>The human-centred design process contains five steps: Framing, Empathising, Synthesising, Concepting and Prototyping.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/hcd.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/responsive/hcd-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/responsive/hcd-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/17/responsive/hcd-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"752\" height=\"278\">\n<figcaption >OACC's HCD Framework</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The two first steps are those involving primary and secondary data collection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Framing</strong> is about understanding the team's capacity based on the available resources as well as defining assets, budget and time. This step's inputs include the project's broad definition and secondary data.</li>\n<li><strong>Empathising</strong> is about collecting primary data and further learning from your context.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Collecting Data</h3>\n<p>To collect primary data, OACC uses one-on-one or small group interviews, while putting co-creation at the centre of their research. For instance, they organise community meetings and workshops to envision what they want to work on visually and creatively. These interactions provide insights into people's point of view and desires.</p>\n<p>OACC also uses surveys, focus groups, and collaboration between focus and research groups to go further.</p>\n<p>In summary, they leverage diverse techniques and tools based on live interactions between local stakeholders and specialists.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we do can create momentum for changes.

My name is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoy-stephen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Benoy Stephen</a>, and I play Ultimate Frisbee. I got introduced to the sport during my last undergrad year. Then, I got the chance to work with <a href=\"https://www.teachforindia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teach for India</a>¬†in a government school in Hyderabad, where I met with some wonderful kids and tried out a few things to support them using Ultimate Frisbee as a tool. In the process, I met <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekanand-srivastava-13b78751/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vivek Srivastava</a> and a few other peers who wanted to do the same and, we all set up Y-Ultimate together, and now, here we are.</p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: I used to sail on ships for 15 years before deciding to do something else and went into business school. During my studies, I loved learning about Organisational Behaviour and became a research assistant in the field. One of my research's topics was ethics at the workplace, and that is how I came across Ultimate Frisbee. Then, I completely went into the sport and started playing full time.</p>\n<p>We are both members of our team and play with our kids. The youngest in our team is 15 years old, and the oldest is me, and I am over 40. We all work hard together!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the end of every Ultimate Frisbee game, a spirit circle takes place. It is a beautiful concept where you have both team members mixing up, coming together in a circle, and then resolving any conflict, giving feedback, appreciating each other so that everyone goes home with a clean slate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What is Ultimate Frisbee?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: Ultimate Frisbee is a non-contact self-refereed mixed-gender sport. It is played with a flying disc, and you could say it is a mixture of basketball and American football.</p>\n<p>Unlike many sports, you have to self-officiate and uphold the rules as a result. This constitutes the fundamental principle on which Ultimate runs, and it is called the spirit of the game (SOTG). You do not use any mind games and always have to remain respectful while playing.</p>\n<p><em>Benoy</em>: Also, at the end of every Ultimate Frisbee game, a spirit circle takes place. It is a beautiful concept where you have both team members mixing up, coming together in a circle, and then resolving any conflict, giving feedback, appreciating each other so that everyone goes home with a clean slate. It is a space for reflection built into the sport that constitutes an excellent tool for learning.¬†</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All along, our biggest motivation has been those kids.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What were your main drivers and motivations to start the organisation?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: In the heart of Delhi, we came across an economically challenged community. The children from this small community would come, watch us play and become enthusiastic about it. They wanted to play, and we pulled them in with us.<br><br>We quickly saw their great potential: they were very athletic and picked up the sport very fast! We were encouraged by how they were growing, so we thought that we needed to develop further this project to sustain it.<br><br>We got donations from family and friends first. Then, inspired by the positive changes that we saw in these children, we registered ourselves as an organisation to support even more children in India. All along, our biggest motivation has been those kids.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you reach out to more children?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: The young kids that we met in Delhi have grown so much as players and individuals. So, we decided to mentor them into becoming our young coaches to help us reach out to more children.</p>\n<p>We have three models to do so. One is through schools: we have both an in-school program and an after-school program - depending on what works best for each school. We also do a community program where we immerse ourselves in a community with the support of a partner organisation and other groups or individuals. Finally, we help other organisations set up their Ultimate Frisbee program, where our youth coaches go, build capacity, and then leave and support them remotely.¬†<br><br><strong>You mentioned you needed funds to pay for the gear and tournaments, for instance. Do you generate revenues to sustain your purpose?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: Most of our revenue comes from donations, and we have individuals who donate to us for a particular community. So, whatever contribution we get goes entirely to the youth coach that is handling that community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many communities want engagement for recreational purposes, but also some communities start aspiring to take the sport more seriously. We are always happy to support them no matter how far they want to go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>How long do you work with a certain group of children?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: The kids we met in Delhi always stay with us and have become our youth coaches, and we plan to stay together. Otherwise, we conduct one-time workshops in communities and schools and continuous coaching programs that last a year or more - depending on the funding, players' availability, community issues, and more.<br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, the youth coaches constitute an essential part of our organisation, and we are all able to teach people right from the beginning (basic level and up). So, it will just depend on the aspirational level of the children. Many communities and NGOs want engagement for recreational purposes, but also some communities start aspiring to take the sport more seriously. We are always happy to support them no matter how far they want to go.</p>\n<p><strong>It is great to hear how you are providing these children with a sense of community and purpose.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, and you know, our children regularly get selected for the Indian national team. Two of our girls have already represented India at an international level. In 2020, we had four of our girls who got selected for an Under-20 (U20) team for India. Unfortunately, the tournament got cancelled because of COVID-19, but that is how good our children are. I also got the chance to play a tournament in France while representing India, and we won the Spirit of the Game Award.<br><br><strong>That is awesome, congratulations guys! I saw you have been to several states in India. So, how many children have you worked with so far?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy:</em>¬† We have worked with more than 1200 children in one year so far.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of our girls wants to grow up to implement policy changes to allow for more gender equality and tackle other issues that she has seen in her village. Others want to become lawyers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Overall, what effects have you seen in their lives as a result of your initiatives?</strong><br><br><em>Vivek</em>: The community in Delhi, previously mentioned, has around 500 children, and we work with 30 of them. So, if you look at their peers, they tend to drop out of school as they do not have the correct support system to help them make the right decisions for their future.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, most of our team's children are doing well in school and have future goals. For instance, one of our girls wants to grow up to implement policy changes to allow for more gender equality and tackle other issues that she has seen in her village. Others want to become lawyers.</p>\n<p>All of this has been very organic - and we think it is related to the nature of the sport. Indeed, Ultimate is an inclusive sport where both genders play together. So, all of our kids have forgotten gender stereotypes. Also, they do not pick up on their peers' bad habits such as smoking and drinking as it is not enough to be gifted to succeed in this sport - you have to put in the effort and discipline to get results.</p>\n<p>So, we have noticed changes in their attitudes such as resilience, discipline, ownership, positivism and inclusiveness; and it is so nice to see what they are now doing with their lives. These changes have kept us going.</p>\n<p><strong>Let's talk more about your journey to become an organisation. Was there anything crucial to make it happen?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: I would say something crucial was constantly seeing our team winning tournaments and the Spirit of the Game Award, calculated based on opponents' rates. So, playing at the highest level of spirit and winning as a result of performing at our best were components that made us keep moving forward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is rare to have both high performance and spirit in a team. In India, the teams that generally win have traditionally not been high on spirit scores. We managed to keep our kids competitive without them becoming aggressive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What do you feel have been your greatest achievements?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: Winning a tournament while having a highly-rated spirit performance is a great achievement for us. Also, we love it when a community reaches out to us to start playing.<br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, I agree. Indeed, it is rare to have both high performance and spirit in a team. In India, the teams that generally win have traditionally not been high on spirit scores. We managed to keep our kids competitive without them becoming aggressive. I do not know how we did it, but it is one of our most outstanding achievements!<br><br><strong>I am aligned with that approach. I believe it is good to seek excellence, but never at the expense of other people.¬†</strong><br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Yes, exactly! The only person we have to beat is ourselves. You can see this mindset in our jump-rope workouts videos. You can notice a huge difference between the beginning and eight months later: this reflects their mentality and how they want to achieve mastery and excellence in what they are doing.<br><br><em>Benoy: </em>Yes, it is noticeable, and it gives me a lot of joy. When I started playing in 2015, I played against a team with smaller kids, so it was easy to throw the Frisbee above their heads, and we ended up winning the game. However, they worked on themselves, learned from their defeats, and never gave up, and now the tables have turned completely: they are one of the best teams in the country at this point.¬†</p>\n<p><strong>What have been your biggest challenges?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Benoy</em>: Even though the International Olympic Committee recognised the sport, our country does not recognise it. So, when you pitch the sport in a school or community, you get asked questions as \"Can I make a career out of this?\" \"Will I get a certificate that is going to help me with a job or an admission somewhere?\" Sadly, the answer to those questions is \"not yet\". So, we have to let them see the potential the sport has and ask them to give us a chance to show them.<br><br><em>Vivek</em>: Another challenge is funding to take care of our coaches, travel costs, gear, and other expenses. We also need to cover the financial incentives we have in place for our kids who teach and coach other children via our paid-forward model. In this model, we try to cross-subsidise our initiatives. For instance, we take the money earned from going to a school to work with socially and economically underprivileged communities. However, as schools do not know well about Ultimate and it is not a well-recognised sport in India, it becomes challenging to sustain our model.</p>\n<p><strong>How can we support your organisation?</strong><br><br><em>Benoy</em>: Donations are welcome because there are constantly a few communities that would like our service pro bono. Also, we are always looking for like-minded people with different skill sets than ours to help us do things better and figure out how to take this best forward. Finally, we look for volunteers to capture our games' greatest moments to communicate about what we are doing.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you envision for the years to come?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vivek</em>: Our mission is to spread out Ultimate Frisbee to as many children as possible.¬†</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To everyone, come and play!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Would you like to share anything else with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Benoy</em>: Try Ultimate Frisbee! If you want to start anywhere in India, reach out to us on our social media platforms, and we will get back to you and support you with whatever you need, even tools to help you build your community to reach out to more children.¬†</p>\n<p>If you are an educator, I would like to share how sports are a great tool to teach children how to accept, recover and learn from a failure. Indeed, even if you put your best foot forward in sports, things might not go as planned.<br><br>To everyone, come and play!</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-3-with-frisbees.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/group-3-with-frisbees-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/in-motion.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x607\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/in-motion-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/frisbees-gk-mad.jpg\" data-size=\"1992x1121\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/frisbees-gk-mad-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-1.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-3.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x810\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-4.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x565\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/playing-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/solidarity.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/solidarity-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/spirit-circle.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x565\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/spirit-circle-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/strategy.jpg\" data-size=\"960x960\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/strategy-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/team-spirit.jpg\" data-size=\"1080x565\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/11/gallery/team-spirit-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Thanks so much for reading this post!</p>\n<p>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your story, reach out to me via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn.</a> I am looking forward to it!</p>",
