Under UV rays, this component absorbs and disperses light and heat, giving the spray its cooling ability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the spray’s “photo catalytic technology” removes nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and other pollutants released by thermic vehicles. According to the company, 1 mile of sprayed pavement can have the same air quality benefits as planting 20 acres of trees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cities throughout the US are currently experimenting with this technology under the supervision of researchers at </span><a href=\"https://pavements.tti.tamu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas A&amp;M University</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Meanwhile, an early experiment at Orlando International Airport suggests that the spray could cut NOx pollution by half.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Heavily built-up areas often experience what is called the “</span><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/heatislands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heat island effect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” In these neighbourhoods - mostly located in low-income areas - heat absorption from buildings and pavement can leave the area up to 4.4 degrees hotter than areas with more trees and green spaces. With the current climate-change-induced heatwaves, this phenomenon could quickly become unsustainable for people who do not have the means to relocate to healthier places.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding trees and green spaces is a longer-term solution for tackling the heat island effect and making these neighbourhoods easier to inhabit. In the meantime, this spray technology can have major public health benefits and lower locals’ energy bills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: </span><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/a-sunscreen-for-pavement-could-help-keep-cities-cool-1847214621\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gizmodo.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"pick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/water.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/responsive/water-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/responsive/water-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/responsive/water-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1919\" height=\"1080\"></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fionn Ferreira, a chemistry student at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, wants to fight microplastic pollution with magnetic water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His idea, which won the 2019 Google Science Fair, was to use a mix of magnetized iron oxide and vegetable oil to attract plastic particles. Then, a magnet can be used to remove this mixture - alongside the microplastics - and leave the water as pristine as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After many experiments, Fionn realized that this method was 87% effective in removing microplastics of all sorts from water. He now aims to scale this technology to have a concrete impact on global pollution. The idea is to capture microplastics from wastewater before it reaches the sea by building a capture system in water treatment and sewage facilities.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Studies estimate the ocean contains 8.3 million pieces of microplastic per cubic metre of water. These microplastics, which are virtually impossible to remove through filtration, end up in the global food chain and, ultimately, on our plate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fionn’s innovation is one of the many projects aiming to remove microplastic from our oceans.

On the other hand, Wind Tulips drive wind tunnels into each other -- making their neighbours perform 20-50% better. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to these innovations, these good-looking turbines are extremely efficient (up to 40%, against 7-10% for their conventional counterparts), especially under slow wind and in limited spaces. They are, therefore, particularly adapted to urban settings.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wind farms' opponents often cite noise and biodiversity concerns along with aesthetic issues. As a result, city residents do not leverage wind energy, despite its huge potential, and rely on solar power as a local source of clean energy. However, the latter doesn’t perform well at night or during the winter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wind Tulips make wind energy available for everybody by allowing people to live and work next to them. Coupled with already existing solar energy sources, they could be the future of locally-produced urban clean energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">theguardian.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"pick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/bison.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Quad Cities, USA, the </span><a href=\"https://bisonbridge.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bison Bridge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> project aims to repurpose Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge on Interstate I-80 to create a wildlife crossing that provides safe passage for bison herds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides saving Illinois millions in demolition costs, this initiative could also attract tourists to this somewhat overlooked part of the country.

His innovative idea is to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210713-how-pedestrians-are-lighting-homes-in-sierra-leone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage kinetic energy</a> – the energy objects have when in motion – to generate clean electricity.</p>\n<p>When he was 17, he designed a piezoelectric device that harnesses energy from heat, movement and pressure. When installed under a road, it absorbs vibrations from the ongoing traffic to generate electric current -- without any external power source nor emissions!</p>\n<p>With only two devices, Optim Energy managed to provide free-of-charge power to 150 households and 15 schools. However, the benefits for the community go beyond its energy needs. Indeed, children's health and school performance improved once they gained access to lighting and lived in smoke-free homes. Also, street lightning increased safety in the neighbourhood, which allowed businesses to stay open later into the evening. Finally, deforestation fell in the area since people no longer rely on firewood.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In Sierra Leone, only 26% of the population has access to electricity. In rural areas, this proportion plunges to 6%. Most families, therefore, rely on charcoal and firewood to generate heat and light, which leads to poor health conditions and frequent house fires. Moreover, the related deforestation made the country highly vulnerable to climate change, extreme flooding and landslides.</p>\n<p>By 2030, Optim Energy intends to provide power to 100,000 people as well as health clinics throughout Sierra Leone. Jeremiah believes that access to energy is a human right. Through his startup, he is developing a sustainable energy system while enhancing education, health and safety in his community 🤩</p>\n<p>(Source: bbc.com)</p>\n<h2 id=\"cows\">🐄 The Device That Reduces Cows’ Methane Emissions</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/cow.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/cow-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1153\" height=\"649\"></figure>Francisco Norris and his brother Patricio come from a cattle-ranching family in Argentina. In the UK, they founded <a href=\"https://www.zelp.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zelp</a>, a company that aims to capture methane emissions at the source.</p>\n<p>Because of their background, they knew that cows exhale most of the methane through their mouth and nostrils, so they designed a device that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90658025/this-mask-for-cows-isnt-for-covid-it-helps-reduce-methane-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sits above the cow’s nose</a> and detects methane. When its level passes a certain threshold, the device absorbs the gas and turns it into water vapour and CO2 -- a far less potent greenhouse gas. According to their research, they can reduce the animal’s emissions to less than 2% of their original value!</p>\n<p>Fransisco insisted that the mechanism remained practical for cattle to wear and did not affect them in any way. While testing the prototype, the team thus made sure to monitor any signs of discomfort, such as changes in how much a cow ate, to implement this vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> In a year, the billion cows and bulls on the planet can each release 200 pounds of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2. Over the next few decades, the United Nations predicts that beef and dairy consumption will rise by 70%, increasing the global cattle population and associated emissions.</p>\n<p>The Zelp device, which should be on the market in 2022, is designed to last 4 years on a cow without requiring any replacement or recharge. Since it also captures and tracks emissions, farmers will increase their margins by featuring the environmental benefit of their milk and even add a new revenue stream by selling carbon credits.</p>\n<p>(Source: fastcompany.com)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"pick\">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/reef.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/34/responsive/reef-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>The Sri Lankan government gives decommissioned buses a second life by sinking them in the ocean to serve as <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2021/07/next-stop-the-sea-sri-lankas-old-buses-are-a-new-home-for-marine-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fish-breeding sites</a>. The Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR) has already sunk dozens of buses at three sites.</p>\n<p>So far, the results are encouraging as the buses have already attracted a lot of fish. Indeed, a bus body structure seems to be ideal for fish to gather around and is also perfect for accumulating algae, mollusks, and corals. Of course, the agency checked the buses were free of pollutants beforehand.</p>\n<p>On land, old buses take up space and offer a pretty poor view. Moreover, they collect rainwater, creating mosquito-breeding sites and contributing to diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. On the other hand, once in the water, they become tourist attractions, on top of the ecological benefits they provide.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Most natural Sri Lankan natural fish breeding spots have been lost to climate change, natural disasters and destructive fishing practices. Protecting these habitats and stopping illegal fishing practices are, therefore, crucial for the country’s biodiversity.</p>\n<p>By repurposing old bus carcasses, the Sri Lankan government implemented an innovative idea that will please both biodiversity and scuba diving enthusiasts 🤿</p>\n<p>(Source: news.mongabay.com)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</h2>\n<p>🤖 4ocean and Poralu Marine partnered to create a <a href=\"https://www.4ocean.com/pages/4ocean-x-poralu-bebot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">robot that picks up microplastics</a> on beaches.

During their experiments, Pennie’s team placed 300 mussels in a tank and found that they filtered out more than 250,000 microplastics per hour! The mussels eventually excrete the microplastics, which naturally sink into the water and become readily disposable. All this happens without causing any harm to the mussels.</p>\n<p>In the future, Pennie also hopes to use the plastic-filled excrements as a biofuel since they are rich in carbon.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Collecting microplastic is difficult.

Indeed, akin to most herbs, this essential ingredient for pesto prefers protected, sunny locations with well-drained soils and a constant, stable temperature - everything the bottom of the sea can provide!</p>\n<p>From this question, Sergio created <a href=\"http://www.nemosgarden.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nemo’s Garden</a>. This project consists of transparent, air-filled biospheres 20 feet below the sea surface to create an alternative agriculture system.</p>\n<p>Underwater agriculture presents many advantages over standard agriculture. First, the biospheres are self-sustainable in terms of water. Indeed, the seawater at the biospheres' bottom evaporates and condensates on the internal surfaces, creating fresh water for the plants. Also, since the biospheres contain a parasite-free closed ecosystem, no pesticide is necessary. Finally, data have shown Sergio’s team that higher pressure conditions positively affect plant growth.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, current experiments demonstrated that the amount of sunlight illuminating the biosphere is sufficient to allow the plants to grow.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Today, <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70% of global fresh water</a> is used for agriculture, and the growing population will further increase the pressure on water resources. In this context, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change.</p>\n<p>For now, Nemo’s Garden is an experiment, and underwater agriculture's limits are yet to be defined.

However, they contain plants and secrete minerals, so the confusion is understandable 😅</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. David Vaughan, Ph.D. in Marine Sciences, wants to plant </span><a href=\"http://plantamillioncorals.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 million corals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, thanks to an innovative technique he discovered by accident!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While moving coral samples in an aquarium, he accidentally broke one into small pieces that fell at the bottom of the aquarium. He thought these corals were lost and forgot about them. A few weeks later, he came back to the aquarium and noticed that they had not only survived but multiplied and grown. By pursuing his research, he discovered that small pieces of coral placed close to each other would grow together and fuse back as one piece.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this micro-fragmentation process, growth and healing happen up to 40 times faster than they occur naturally on the reef. It means that it could take only a couple of years to restore 100-year-old corals! David envisions using this innovative technique to reproduce resistant coral strains and recover the lost reefs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With 25-40% already lost, the worldwide coral population is in incredible danger. They provide habitats for numerous fish (including Nemo and Dory!), and fisheries depend on them for up to 40% of their catch. Coral reefs are also the rainforests of the sea: they absorb heaps of carbon dioxide and produce a large amount of the oxygen we breathe. Finally, they protect the shorelines from waves and storms and help mitigate climate change effects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time to find Nemo has passed.

This African-led movement has the ambition to grow an 8,000km natural wonder of the world across the entire width of Africa. The goal is to create a barrier against climate change running across the Sahel region – from Senegal to Djibouti. The Sahel forms a transitional zone between the Sahara desert and the rainforest and is one of the poorest places on Earth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once complete, the Great Green Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet, 3 times bigger than Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Since its beginning in 2007, this initiative brought food security, jobs and stability to locals. More than just growing trees and plants, the Great Green Wall is thus transforming millions of lives in the Sahel region. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the region became virtually uncultivable due to climate change and deforestation. The lack of rainwater allows saltwater from the sea to move upstream and destroy crops. Moreover, without trees, the soil has lost all its nutrients, and crops don’t grow. This situation led to biodiversity loss, poverty, mass emigration, violence and food insecurity. The Great Green Wall isn’t just for the Sahel, though. It could contribute to solving the world’s pressing threats – notably climate change, drought, famine, conflict and migration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: pioneerspost.com)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">📌 Google </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/04/22/google-maps-recycling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Google Maps would display featured businesses’ sustainable practices.

Also, she </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">educated herself on the problems and the related solutions to provide them to others. </span></p>\n<p>In our discussion, we uncovered some tips to learn continuously while building and growing an organization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Managing time</strong>. Having a schedule and a routine is essential to free time dedicated to learning. For instance, grouping meetings together can be useful to avoid context switching.</li>\n<li><strong>Collecting feedback</strong>. While talking with the people you want to help, you should take any opportunity to understand their biggest pain points and adapt your offer accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Leveraging tools and automation</strong>. Handling everything manually is not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, you should automate as much as possible, as soon as possible, to focus your energy on learning and performing other high-value tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Asking for help</strong>. You are not supposed to learn everything by yourself. W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hen a topic is outside your area of expertise, consider reaching out to people who can provide you with insights into the subject at hand.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Accepting mistakes</strong>. Mistakes happen, and you should not beat yourself up over them. The key is to learn from them and use these experiences to improve and make better decisions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Testing your ideas early</strong>. D<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on't wait for your product to be perfect. Instead, try to discard or validate your assumptions early on. The later you find out about a wrong assumption, the greater the cost. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Trusting the process</strong>. Growing an organization takes time. So be patient, appreciate what you are achieving, celebrate the victories - whatever their magnitude - and try to avoid frustration in the face of adversity.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inspiration to Go!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at what you can give to people. It's not always money. It's not always your time. It's also your expertise, your knowledge. I believe everybody has something to give.</p>\n</blockquote>",
