The first experiment they hope to conduct soon involves injecting large amounts of ice into the storm's eye to reduce its overall pressure and intensity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another idea is to deploy a fleet of remote-controlled ships into a storm that gathers and stores energy from wind and undersea turbines. In fact, according to their estimation, the energy of a single powerful typhoon could meet the global demand for energy for an entire month!</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Today, mainland Japan is relatively safe from super typhoons. However, the country already suffers from \"regular\" typhoons, and climate change is likely to send more powerful ones in the years to come. Also, Japan's access to energy sources is limited, and many worry about the country's zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harnessing a super typhoon's energy seems like a highly challenging task. However, success in such a game-changing endeavour would completely change how we see typhoons. Indeed, they would become a blessing rather than a threat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: </span><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/japan-bids-to-harness-the-energy-of-super-typhoons/a-59483087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dw.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>",

After ten years of research and development, Søuld adapted that traditional building technique into a modern process that leverages the eelgrass’ CO2-binding properties to create furniture that also serves as a carbon sink.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, this highly fashionable, recyclable and non-toxic furniture creates a healthier indoor environment. Indeed, it dampens noise and provides acoustic comfort, and absorbs and releases moisture without rotting to create a healthy indoor climate free from bacteria, mould and other microbes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, these products offer thermal insulation, resistance to fire and can last more than 150 years, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US </span><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> indicated that indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, leading to asthma, decreased lung function and heart issues. And, with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, indoor air quality is even more crucial.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on our location, the weather can generate humid conditions, breeding mould in our home. In this context, investing in a dehumidifier can go a long way to creating a healthier environment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our homes usually feature many filters that help us eliminate pollutants, dust and allergens. However, we should make sure to change the filter of our vacuum cleaner, clothes dryer, kitchen vent and AC regularly to ensure their proper functioning – especially if we live in a metropolitan area with high pollution levels.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we can leverage nature and install a few indoor plants to clean our environment while improving our mood and enhancing our home décor. Small plants like ferns and lilies and larger palm trees are the best options to pull contaminants out of the air. However, be careful about potential allergies before your next trip to your local florist!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Søuld’s approach respects the cultural heritage of eelgrass while meeting the design and environmental needs of today.</span></p>",

Indeed, it dampens noise and provides acoustic comfort, and absorbs and releases moisture without rotting to create a healthy indoor climate free from bacteria, mould and other microbes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, these products offer thermal insulation, resistance to fire and can last more than 150 years, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US </span><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> indicated that indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, leading to asthma, decreased lung function and heart issues. And, with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, indoor air quality is even more crucial.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on our location, the weather can generate humid conditions, breeding mould in our home. In this context, investing in a dehumidifier can go a long way to creating a healthier environment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our homes usually feature many filters that help us eliminate pollutants, dust and allergens. However, we should make sure to change the filter of our vacuum cleaner, clothes dryer, kitchen vent and AC regularly to ensure their proper functioning – especially if we live in a metropolitan area with high pollution levels.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we can leverage nature and install a few indoor plants to clean our environment while improving our mood and enhancing our home décor. Small plants like ferns and lilies and larger palm trees are the best options to pull contaminants out of the air. However, be careful about potential allergies before your next trip to your local florist!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Søuld’s approach respects the cultural heritage of eelgrass while meeting the design and environmental needs of today.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🎯 <a href=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/japan-wants-to-harness-the-energy-of-super-typhoons-to-reach-climate-goals.html\">The Guild’s Pick</a></span></h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/typhoon.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/106/responsive/typhoon-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Japanese \"Typoonshot\" project aims to mitigate typhoon-related risks and harness their energy to help the country reach zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the brand new Typhoon Science and Technology Research Center at </span><a href=\"https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/\" target=\"null\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yokohama National University</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, researchers, analysts and experts are working together to find ways to reduce the damage typhoons cause and collect the massive amount of clean energy they generate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the project is only at the beginning, experts already consider many methods to achieve its goals. The first experiment they hope to conduct soon involves injecting large amounts of ice into the storm's eye to reduce its overall pressure and intensity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another idea is to deploy a fleet of remote-controlled ships into a storm that gathers and stores energy from wind and undersea turbines. In fact, according to their estimation, the energy of a single powerful typhoon could meet the global demand for energy for an entire month!</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Today, mainland Japan is relatively safe from super typhoons. However, the country already suffers from \"regular\" typhoons, and climate change is likely to send more powerful ones in the years to come. Also, Japan's access to energy sources is limited, and many worry about the country's zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harnessing a super typhoon's energy seems like a highly challenging task. However, success in such a game-changing endeavour would completely change how we see typhoons. Indeed, they would become a blessing rather than a threat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(source: </span><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/japan-bids-to-harness-the-energy-of-super-typhoons/a-59483087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dw.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide …</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">🎵 The Egyptian duo </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/Elboumaband/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ElBouma</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> creates music that gives voice to the girls and women in rural areas of Egypt.
