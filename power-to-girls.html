My name is Aisha, and I am the founder of an organisation called Power To Girls. We provide leadership, personal development, mental health, and entrepreneurship training that support Black and marginalised girls. We have been doing this for the past eight years, and it is something that I care deeply about. The idea is to empower these girls and create safe spaces for them.</p><p><strong>Can you tell me more about all the activities that you do to support these young girls?</strong><br><br>Yes, absolutely. We have a partnership with the <a href="https://www.tcdsb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toronto Catholic District School Board</a> to deliver our programs within the schools.</p><p>We focus mainly on girls that are in middle school (6th to 8th grades), and essentially run a series of programs and workshops that highlight and address our four main pillars: mental health, leadership, mentorship and entrepreneurship.</p><p>We ensure that the girls are given a space that allows for them to be themselves, pick up on all these programs, and become whoever they want to become in the future.<br><br><strong>What were your drivers and motivation to start the foundation?</strong></p><p>I came to Canada as an immigrant, and my first experience was in high school. I was going through my teenage years with all those questions, and not really finding a space that allowed for me to tap into those questions as a source of empowerment. Seeing that Black girls did not have places to express themselves was a first key motivator for me to start Power To Girls.</p><p>Everything shifted when I ended up in foster care (from 15 to 18 years old).  I remember my foster mom having a conversation with me and explaining to me that the system that has been assigned to me did not necessarily expect much of me. Basically, I was expected to either become a teenage mom, a dropout, a drug addict, etc. </p><p>I remember saying to myself <em>"I'm not going to be your stereotype, and I'm not going to be in a stereotype!"</em>.</p><p>These two experiences coupled with other ones<span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> became the driving force for Power to Girls, as I realised that even girls that might not necessarily find themselves in foster care still need sources of inspiration and have those moments of questioning about who they are.</span></p><p><strong>Can a young girl get support after the middle-school programs?</strong></p><p>We focus on young girls in elementary schools, but we still provide support for you later on, when you get into high school for instance.</p><p>In the next couple of months, we are actually launching My Power App, an application that focuses specifically on connecting girls to mentors, and providing support through the app itself.</p><p>So, we are really proud of the beautiful cycle it becomes. Indeed, the girls that participate in our programs always end up coming back as mentors or facilitators. The majority of the facilitators that we have now are girls that have participated in our program in the past. Once you have joined Power to Girls, you are part of the Power to Girls family, you are stuck with us, so to speak!<br><br><strong>What effects have you noticed in the lives of the girls that you are helping as a result of your initiatives?</strong><br><br>This is always a very interesting question because our programs focus on self-reflection and personal development.</p><p>It is always beautiful to notice the changes within our goals. We have programs where some people are super quiet in the beginning. Getting closer to the end of the programs, they are more comfortable in who they are and expressive. Also, <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">we have had girls that have started their own businesses in one of our entrepreneurship programs, a</span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">nd we have seen them getting the confidence to share and talk about their businesses.</span></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">So, we witness changes in their communication style and self-confidence. We are also able to see them being comfortable and beautiful in their own body, and feeling comfortable enough to speak up when something does not feel right for them.</span></p><p><strong>I find your organisation interesting, because you provide these girls with a holistic support system, including a set of complementary tools that let them blossom. I think it helps them today, and it will also open opportunities for them in the future. Also, it is great to see that they also are able to support other girls later on as well. So, congratulations!</strong></p><p><strong>Let's talk more about your journey as a social entrepreneur. What steps did you have to take to create the foundation, and how long did it take to kick start it?</strong><br><br>Yes, that is a really good question. I started Power to Girls when I was in college. So, it started based on my passion of not having girls experience some of the things that I experienced in Canada and society in general.</p><p>Then, I realised that I wanted to turn it more than a passion down the road. So, I wondered, how do I turn this passion into purpose? How can I turn this project into something that is beyond myself, that will still strive and go on even when I am not around? The journey has not been easy: you have to find the right people, support, and many other things related to entrepreneurial journey itself.</p><p>Currently, we have three full-time staff, fifteen facilitators that we can always count on and mentors. We also have folks that want to be a part of our organisation, we provide them with training and then, they go back and provide training themselves. So, we are now running out a really amazing, oiled machine which not only provides employment, but also support.</p><p>I am recognizing the magnitude of what we are doing now that I am speaking to you. It has been a process, and did not get here overnight. It was something that we worked  hard to make it happen. I am actually proud now that I sit here and talk about it. Often we are head down doing the work, not necessarily realise how far we have come.</p><p>I am also able to share this because I have got some amazing people that believe in the vision and the work that we are doing. So, they are also able to give freely of themselves and passionately to the cause. I think it is crucial to work with folks that are smarter than you, but also actually care about what you are working on. I believe that what makes the difference is that they care because when they do, everything is different as there is sense of ownership to what it is that you are doing.<br><br><strong>It is rare to see something happen overnight. It is often a lot of work. To me, it is a good thing that you work on something that you are care about to enjoy the work that you do to achieve your goals. Even when you see some stories of people that have succeeded overnight, it is actually not overnight. It usually involves a lot of previous experiences, maybe some failures, a lot of work, etc.</strong></p><p><strong>So, what were your biggest challenges at the different stages of your journey?</strong><br><br>Yes, that is a really good question. One of the biggest challenges I have had is accessing capital, as many other entrepreneurs might say. So, when the need arises, I do not mind taking out of my pocket to do it because it is something that I care deeply about. </p><p>Otherwise, since I originally studied accounting in school and social work was not my first choice, accessing the resources, skills and support that would allow us to scale the organisation would be challenging as well - especially since we are taring to grow and we are going to launch our application. <br><br><br><strong>How are you tackling these challenges? For instance, how do you gain access to funds?</strong></p><p>It is a matter of networking and trying to find different opportunities for us to build partnerships. Also, applying to more grants. </p><p>Otherwise, having the platform that we are currently creating is also allowing us to automate things.</p><p>Finally, we look for people that are going to become champions of the organisation and support us, throughout our growth and journey. We are so grateful for the partners that we have now and the ones to come.<br><br><strong>What is the status of your organisation?</strong><br><br>We are a not-for-profit organisation registered in Canada, and in Ghana as well.<br><br><strong>Do you generate revenues to sustain your purpose?</strong></p><p>We do generate revenues from the sale of our merchandise that are funneled back into the organisation.<br><br><strong>How has the pandemic affected your work and how have you adapted so far?</strong><br><br>We are closely tied to like the school and education system.</p><p>Whatever happens to the school system indirectly happens to us because we normally run our programs within the schools. Also, as a result of the pandemic, some funding has been put on hold.</p><p>When the pandemic first started, we were very focused on you ensuring that people and our communities are safe. Now, we are adapting into a more online module, which has been great for us as we have been able to reach more people.</p><p>The downside is that you lose the sense of strong connection online, but we see it as a reinforcement of the work that we do. We are still able to maintain the sense of support from each other. </p><p><strong>Do you have any strategies to tackle these differences resulting from moving to online programs?</strong></p><p>Reinforcing who we are as individuals to create a sense of connection. Also, we continuously remind people that this is a safe space to talk and that everything we are doing is for their benefit. </p><p><strong>What do you feel have been your greatest achievements as a social entrepreneur?</strong><br><br>Right now, I am really excited about the app, and just what we have done with it in the middle of the pandemic because it is something that I have always wanted to do.<br><br>Also, I am very proud of my work with Power to Girls, my team, the people that I got the opportunity to work with, and my girls for always showing up and being present.<br> <br>Finally, I am proud of myself for sticking it through because honestly it has not been an easy journey and many times we had wanted to give up but we kept going. Now, the girls that we wanted to help got the support they needed because we did not give up!</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the years to come and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong><br><br>At a personal level, being at peace and ensuring that everything that I do stems from passion and love.<br><br>From an organisational standpoint, launching the app, impacting and supporting more girls, and expanding our work into places we have not been yet.<br> <br>The idea is taking it one day at a time, being conscious that we are capable of  accomplishing everything that we set our minds to, and ensuring that we are safe while we do so.<br><br><strong>Would you like to share anything else with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong></p><p>We are recruiting for mentors as well as testers for the app. If you are interested in participating in our alpha testing, go to this link: <a href="https://app.powertogirls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.powertogirls.com/</a></p><p>Donors and supporters are always appreciated.
