My name is Aisha, and I am the founder of an organisation called Power to Girls. We provide leadership, personal development, mental health, and entrepreneurship training to support Black and marginalised girls. We have been doing this for the past eight years, and I care deeply about it.</p><p><strong>Can you tell me more about the activities that you do to support these young girls?</strong><br><br>Yes, absolutely. We have a partnership with the <a href="https://www.tcdsb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toronto Catholic District School Board</a> to deliver our programs within the schools.</p><p>We focus mainly on girls in middle school (6th to 8th grades) and essentially run programs and workshops that highlight and address our four main pillars: mental health, leadership, mentorship, and entrepreneurship.</p><p>We ensure that the girls have a space that allows them to be themselves, pick up on all these programs, and become whomever they want to become in the future.</p><blockquote><p>The system that had been assigned to me did not necessarily expect much of me. [...] I remember saying to myself, <em>"I'm not going to be a stereotype!"</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>What were your drivers and motivation to start the foundation?</strong></p><p>I came to Canada as an immigrant, and my first experience was in high school. I was going through my teenage years and could not find a space that allowed me to tap into the questions I had as a source of empowerment. Seeing that Black girls did not have places to express themselves was the first key motivator to start Power to Girls.</p><p>Everything shifted when I ended up in foster care (from 15 to 18 years old). I remember my foster mom having a conversation with me and explaining that the system assigned to me did not necessarily expect much of me. I was expected to either become a teenage mom, dropout, drug addict, etc.Â </p><p>I remember saying to myself, <em>"I'm not going to be a stereotype!"</em>.</p><p>These two experiences, coupled with other ones, became the driving forces for Power to Girls, as I realised that even girls who might not necessarily find themselves in foster care still need inspiration sources and have those moments of questioning about who they are.</p><blockquote><p>The girls that participate in our programs always end up coming back as mentors or facilitators. [...] Once you have joined Power to Girls, you are part of the Power to Girls family.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Can a young girl get support after the middle-school programs?</strong></p><p>We focus on young girls in middle school, but we still support them later on when they get into high school, for instance.</p><p>In the next couple of months, we are launching My Power App, an application that focuses specifically on connecting girls to mentors and providing support.</p><p>So, we are proud of the beautiful cycle it becomes. Indeed, the girls that participate in our programs always end up coming back as mentors or facilitators. The majority of our facilitators are girls that have participated in our program in the past. Once you have joined Power to Girls, you are part of the Power to Girls family.</p><blockquote><p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">We have witnessed changes in their communication style and self-confidence. We [have also seen] them being comfortable and beautiful in their own body and feeling confident enough to speak up when something does not feel right for them.</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>What effects have you noticed in these girls' lives as a result of your initiatives?</strong><br><br>This question is always very interesting because our programs focus on self-reflection and personal development.</p><p>It is always beautiful to notice the changes within our girls. We have programs where some people are super quiet initially, but, getting closer to the end of the programs, they become more comfortable in who they are and expressive. Also, <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">we have had girls that have started their businesses in one of our entrepreneurship programs, a</span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">nd we have seen them get the confidence to share and talk about their businesses.</span></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">So, we have witnessed changes in their communication style and self-confidence. We have also seen them being comfortable and beautiful in their own body and feeling confident enough to speak up when something does not feel right for them.</span></p><p><strong>I think you provide these girls with a holistic support system that includes a set of complementary tools that let them blossom. I believe it helps them today, and it will also open opportunities for them in the future. Also, it is great to see that they are able to support other girls later on as well.</strong></p><blockquote><p>We did not get here overnight. It was something that we worked hard to accomplish.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Let's talk more about your journey as a social entrepreneur. What steps did you take to create the foundation, and how long did it take to kick start it?</strong><br><br>Yes, that is an excellent question. I started Power to Girls when I was in college. So, it started based on my passion for not having girls experience some of the things I did in Canada and society.</p><p>Then, I realised that I wanted to turn it into more than a passion down the road. So, I wondered, how do I turn this passion into purpose? And, How can I turn it into something that is beyond me and would strive even when I am not around? The journey has not been easy as you have to find the right people, support, and other things related to the entrepreneurial journey itself.</p><p>Currently, we have three full-time staff, 15 facilitators that we can always count on, and mentors. We also have folks who want to be part of our organisation. We provide them with training, then they go back and provide training themselves. So, we are now running an amazing oiled machine that not only provides employment but also support.</p><p>I am recognising the magnitude of what we are doing now that I am speaking to you! It has been a process, and we did not get here overnight. It was something that we worked hard to accomplish.</p><p>I can also share this because I have got some great people who believe in our vision. I think it is crucial to work with people smarter than you and actually care about what you are working on, as it generates a sense of ownership.<br><br><strong>It is rare to see anything happen overnight. It is a good thing to work on something that you care about to enjoy the effort you will have to put on. Even for the people who appear to have succeeded overnight, it usually involves many experiences, maybe some failures, a lot of work, etc.</strong></p><p><strong>So, what have been your biggest challenges at the different stages of your journey?</strong><br><br>It has been challenging to access capital. When the need arises, I do not mind taking it out of my pocket because I deeply care about it.Â </p><p>Otherwise, since I originally studied Accounting in school, and social work was not my first choice, accessing the resources, skills and support that would allow us to scale the organisation is also challenging.<br><br><strong>How have you been tackling these challenges?</strong></p><p>It is a matter of networking and trying to find different opportunities for us to build partnerships. Also, we have been applying for more grants.</p><p>Otherwise, having the platform that we are currently creating is also allowing us to automate things.</p><p>Finally, we look for people who will become champions of the organisation and support us throughout our journey and growth. We are grateful for the partners we have now and the ones to come.<br><br><strong>What is the status of your organisation? Do you generate revenues to sustain your purpose?</strong><br><br>We are a not-for-profit organisation registered in Canada and Ghana. We do generate revenues from the sale of our merchandise, which are funnelled back into the organisation.<br><br><strong>How has the pandemic affected your work, and how have you adapted so far?</strong><br><br>We are closely tied to the school and education system. Whatever happens to the school system indirectly happens to us. Also, as a result of the pandemic, some funding has been put on hold.</p><p>When the pandemic first started, we were focused on ensuring that people and our communities were safe. Now, we are adapting to a more online module, and it has been great for us as we have been able to reach more people.</p><p><strong>Do you have any strategies to tackle the challenges resulting from moving to online programs?</strong></p><p>Reinforcing who we are as individuals to create a sense of connection. Also, we continuously remind people that it is a safe space to talk and everything we are doing is for their benefit.</p><blockquote><p>I am very proud of my team, the people I have worked with, and my girls for always showing up and being present.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What do you feel have been your greatest achievements as a social entrepreneur?</strong></p><p>I am excited about the app and what we have done with it in the middle of the pandemic because it is something that I have always wanted to do.<br><br>Also, I am very proud of my team, the people I have worked with, and my girls for always showing up and being present.<br>Â <br>Finally, I am proud of myself for persevering because it has not been an easy journey, and many times we had wanted to give up, but we kept going.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the years to come, and how do you plan to materialise it?</strong><br><br>At a personal level, I envision being at peace and ensuring that everything I do stems from passion and love.<br><br>From an organisational standpoint, I want to launch the app, impact and support more girls, and expand our work into places we have not reached yet.<br>Â <br>The idea is taking it one day at a time, being conscious that can accomplishing everything that we set our minds to, and ensuring that we are safe while we do so.<br><br><strong>Would you like to share anything else with the people who are going to see this interview?</strong></p><p>We are recruiting mentors as well as testers for the app. If you are interested in participating in our alpha testing, go to this link: <a href="https://app.powertogirls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.powertogirls.com/</a></p><p>Donors and supporters are always appreciated.
