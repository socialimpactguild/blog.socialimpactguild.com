The generated electricity provided them with economic opportunities and quality of life. Indeed, it allowed fisherpeople to work at night, kids to do their homework and families to light their homes and charge their phones.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot was a tremendous success. Now, the companies want to scale this concept for many developing nations such as Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Gabon, Somalia and Syria that lack access to energy but do have a coastline.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization, 840 million people worldwide have limited access to electricity, which significantly impedes their ability to work, study and live properly after sunset and stay connected to the rest of the world. Also, electricity demand will increase by 70% by 2035, and traditional fossil fuel reserves should deplete in the next 50 years.</span></p><h2 id="capsule"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♻ <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/french-startup-wants-to-end-microplatic-with-biodegradable-microcapsules.html">The Startup That Wants to End Microplastic</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/laundry.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/laundry-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/laundry-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/42/responsive/laundry-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French startup </span><a href="https://calyxia.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calyxia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invented the world's first customizable, advanced and sustainable microencapsulation technology.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company's biodegradable microcapsules can prove extremely useful for many industries. For instance, laundry detergent manufacturers use microcapsules to retain fragrance for longer. Also, farmers utilize them to slowly release active compounds, reducing the amount required to treat their crops. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calyxia’s technology allows for the encapsulation of any ingredient with over 200 different shell materials. Moreover, unlike conventional products, Calyxia microcapsules are non-porous, protecting their active ingredients in extreme environments.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, Calyxia is developing coatings that would prevent plastic products from eventually disintegrating.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Microcapsules traditionally contain plastic that breaks up into microplastics. These small pieces of plastic then end up down the drain or in our food, harming aquatic life and our health. Also, industries will have to find alternatives before the EU's microplastic ban takes effect in 2022.</span></p><p><strong>What can we do? </strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant part of the microplastics we generate in our day-to-day lives come from our clothes. We can reduce them by running our washing machines with a lower setting to limit the force with which our clothes are thrown around. We can also invest in</span><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/microplastics-laundry-filters-dramatically-reduce-fibres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">filters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or plastic-free clothes. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other sources of microplastics include single-use plastic and car tires.
