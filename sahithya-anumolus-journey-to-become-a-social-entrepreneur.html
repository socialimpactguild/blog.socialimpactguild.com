She believes that <em>"all children should have the same opportunity to explore, learn and excel"</em>. Today, she is the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/">Inqui-Lab Foundation</a>, a social enterprise fostering inquisitiveness and problem-solving skills among children to <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/empowering-the-next-generation-of-innovators-with-inqui-labs-sahithya-anumolu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">empower the next generation of innovators</a>. </p><p>The Inqui-Lab Foundation started in 2017, and has recently moved from impacting the lives of 3,000 to 23,000 children through a program called the <a href="https://www.inquilabfoundation.org/copy-2-of-program">School Innovation Challenge</a>, in partnership with UNICEF, the <a href="https://www.teamtsic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telangana State Innovation Cell</a>, the Education Department of Telangana and volunteering makers.</p><blockquote><p>We started the organisation and we are running it, but we always ask ourselves on a yearly and monthly basis whether we have the skills required for the next stage or current stage of our organisation. We constantly think about what we need to plug the gaps.</p></blockquote><p>Sahithya and her co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshwarbt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eshwar Bandi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-piddempally-b2242143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivek Piddempally</a> knew each other for less than a year before they launched the foundation. They readily established a common vision through discovery and communication. However, growing their skills as social entrepreneurs required mentorship, time, and peer feedback, to understand what it means and shift from a project to an organisation.</p><p>Today, I would consider her a <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/what-is-a-social-entrepreneur.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social entrepreneur</a> since her foundation is a nonprofit, generating revenues through workshops and other activities to grow its operations. They are primarily focused on impacting the lives of students from economically disadvantaged places at a large scale, while ensuring a sustainable business.</p><blockquote><p>Every six months came with its own challenges. It was either a primary skill gap, or being unhappy about where the program was at. I pick a battle every month or every three months, but I also proactively try to find solutions and see how to surpass it.</p></blockquote><p>Social entrepreneurship comes with its challenges, often unrelated to a social cause. In this case, Sahithya mainly highlighted challenges revolving around personal development, establishing boundaries to work, thinking about the big picture and scaling. None of which are directly linked to their purpose.</p><p>Struggling with boundaries between work and personal life is something that often comes up for entrepreneurs. We tend to have difficulties with determining when to stop working and we forget to take care of ourselves during the process, sometimes leading to burnout or less effective and efficient work. If we do forget ourselves, I would say it is important to take it easy, and move on.</p><p>Also, I have noticed several women entrepreneurs talk about their need of accomplishing too much too fast. Sahithya mentioned her impatience vis-<span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">à</span></span>-vis her own learning curve or how rapidly the Inqui-Lab Foundation was growing. </p><p>To overcome these challenges, she highlighted two main takeaways:</p><ul><li>Proactively talking to other people brings you perspective and insights that can help you along the way <span class="nounderlines">– even though it can be difficult when you are introverted, it is definitely worthwhile</span>. </li><li>Getting time in the morning for exercise, meditation, reading and skill building energises you by taking a step back and helps with establishing boundaries to work.</li></ul><p>Contextually, Sahithya also recognises that it has been difficult to learn from organisations in India that are doing similar work, unless they are partners <span class="nounderlines">– even though they share the same goals</span>. She even mentioned wondering herself what each of her project's unique value was after talking to some of her peers. This feeling is also something that many entrepreneurs seem to experience. With time, Sahithya has seen value in establishing partnerships by witnessing first-hand the power of Inqui-Lab's collaborations with <a href="https://www.unicef.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNICEF</a>, <a href="https://unleash.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNLEASH</a>, and other organisations.</p><p>In this regard, I think we should ask ourselves whether a partnership could exist and how could it lead to accomplishing greater outcomes, while keeping in mind the end goal: having more impact, offering something unique, sharing resources, learning from each other, etc. </p><blockquote><p>During the pandemic, we spent around a quarter just helping other organisations around food programs, donations, etc., which was not necessarily directly aligned to problem solving, or working with children.</p></blockquote><p>Even though COVID-19 impacted Inqui-Lab's operations, they quickly thought about how to deliver their programs to students in a different way. They did multiple experiments and ended up designing the previously mentioned School Innovation Challenge with UNICEF.</p><blockquote><p>This project was a turning point for us, but as many children do not have access to internet, we still have work to do to figure out how to best reach them.</p></blockquote><p>Macroshocks tend to accelerate something that was already going to happen by constantly pushing you to adapt though innovation. In times like this, I think it is important to have a high-level perspective to understand the situation and its implications, and imagine what steps we should take to blossom. Often, as for this instance, many opportunities emerge in these uncertain times <span class="nounderlines">– </span>where the cards have been reshuffled for everyone and where we need to think differently.</p><hr><p>Thanks so much for reading this post, I hope you enjoyed it! <br>If you are a social entrepreneur and would like to chat with me, feel free to reach out to me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 22, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fsahithya-anumolus-journey-to-become-a-social-entrepreneur.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fsahithya-anumolus-journey-to-become-a-social-entrepreneur.html&amp;via=nphumbert&amp;text=Sahithya%20Anumolu's%20Journey%20as%20a%20Social%20Entrepreneur" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.socialimpactguild.com%2Fsahithya-anumolus-journey-to-become-a-social-entrepreneur.html&amp;title=Sahithya%20Anumolu's%20Journey%20as%20a%20Social%20Entrepreneur" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/tags/social-entrepreneurship/">Social Entrepreneurship</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/website/nadia.png" loading="lazy" alt="Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz"><div><h3><a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/authors/nadia-humbert-labeaumaz/" class="invert" rel="author">Nadia Humbert-Labeaumaz</a></h3><p>Entrepreneur, consultant, bio-sciences and software engineer, working on projects to effect social impact.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments"><div class="post__inner"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
