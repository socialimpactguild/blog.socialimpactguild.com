Indeed, akin to most herbs, this essential ingredient for pesto prefers protected, sunny locations with well-drained soils and a constant, stable temperature - everything the bottom of the sea can provide!</p><p>From this question, Sergio created <a href="http://www.nemosgarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo’s Garden</a>. This project consists of transparent, air-filled biospheres 20 feet below the sea surface to create an alternative agriculture system.</p><p>Underwater agriculture presents many advantages over standard agriculture. First, the biospheres are self-sustainable in terms of water. Indeed, the seawater at the biospheres' bottom evaporates and condensates on the internal surfaces, creating fresh water for the plants. Also, since the biospheres contain a parasite-free closed ecosystem, no pesticide is necessary. Finally, data have shown Sergio’s team that higher pressure conditions positively affect plant growth.</p><p>Otherwise, current experiments demonstrated that the amount of sunlight illuminating the biosphere is sufficient to allow the plants to grow.</p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Today, <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70% of global fresh water</a> is used for agriculture, and the growing population will further increase the pressure on water resources. In this context, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change.</p><p>For now, Nemo’s Garden is an experiment, and underwater agriculture's limits are yet to be defined. However, this project is extremely interesting for our planet's future as it uses renewable energy from the sun and generates fresh water from sea water desalination.</p><h2 id="laser">🐞 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/the-team-that-wants-to-replace-pesticides-with-laser-beams.html">The Team That Wants to Replace Pesticides With Laser Beams</a></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/pea.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/pea-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1920" height="1081"></figure><p>A team of researchers in Lyon, France, leveraged their knowledge in artificial intelligence to develop a technology that identifies and removes pests from plants. For their proof of concept, they chose a particularly tough opponent.</p><p>The pea aphid is a sap-sucking insect that feeds on legumes such as pea, clover, alfalfa, and broad bean. This pest is extremely hard to find since it’s only a few millimetres long, enjoys hiding below the leaves and is green!</p><p>​<a href="https://anr-greenshield.insa-lyon.eu/en/node/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenshield Technology</a>’s robot can drive through the plants without crushing them and take pictures with its embedded camera. It then uses an innovative algorithm to identify pea aphids in the pictures. Once found, it eliminates them with a patented robotized laser beam.</p><p>The team managed to calibrate the laser beam to remove the insect without damaging the plant or affect the overall biodiversity in any way.</p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Usually, farmers get rid of pests such as pea aphids with pesticides. However, only 0.3% of sprayed pesticides come in contact with the target pest. Moreover, they also affect pollinating insects and humans.</p><p>The Greenshield project could be a major breakthrough for sustainable agriculture and biodiversity protection 🐝</p><p>(source: insa-lyon.fr)</p><p> </p><h2 id="pick">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/mosquitia.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/mosquitia-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/mosquitia-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/31/responsive/mosquitia-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1000" height="563"></figure><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MosquitiaMed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MosquitiaMed</a> is a volunteer-based organization using telemedicine to improve access to health for the Miskitos community in Honduras.

If required, it can also gather resources to move the patient to Tegucigalpa and treat them for free.</p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong>Although Gracias a Dios—the Miskitos community's department—is the second largest in Honduras, it can only be reached by air or water. Also, this department is one of the poorest and has one of the worst health indicators in the country.

The only remaining question is, does it pop?</p><p>🤖 When this little girl found out about the ocean crisis, she asked her inventor father to build a robot to save the seas. Alongside his wife, he created <a href="https://www.aquaai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aquaai</a>, a fish-like robot that can immerse within nature to monitor water quality in underwater farms, marine protected areas and ports. Truth comes out from the children's mouth.</p><p>💅 The Kiwi organization <a href="https://lgfb.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Look Good, Feel Better</a> provides free support, guidance and classes to men, women and teens with cancer.
