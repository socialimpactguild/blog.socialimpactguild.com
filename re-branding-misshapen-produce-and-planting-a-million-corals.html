What if we could embrace them as they are, regardless of their appearance?</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former accountant in Auckland, Sarah Balle, is launching </span><a href="https://supie.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online supermarket that focuses on sustainability and local producers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up on a vegetable farm, she witnessed first-hand perfectly healthy produce being wasted because of its aspect. So, she spent 18 months travelling the country to talk to producers and realized their main issue was getting access to supermarkets that would sell their produce.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah’s online store aims to act as the only intermediate between growers and consumers while leaving cosmetic considerations out of the equation. Her goal is to educate consumers and create a store where "ugly" fruit and vegetables are the norm.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world wastes about 1.3 billion tonnes of food every year, and imperfect produce accounts for around 40% of this total. The food wasted in New Zealand alone could feed a city like Dunedin for </span><a href="https://lovefoodhatewaste.co.nz/food-waste/what-we-waste/#:~:text=How%20much%20food%20do%20we,about%20%241.17%20billion%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost 3 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even though some of this food is being fed to animals or composted and used to fertilize the soil, preventing this waste could go a long way towards food security and economic growth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiatives like Supie can provide consumers with more sustainable options at a similar price to existing players. Let’s focus on the health characteristics of what we eat rather than what it looks like 🙈</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: stuff.co.nz)</span></p><h2 id="coral"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐠 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/the-doctor-who-wants-to-plant-1-million-corals.html">The Doctor Who Wants to Plant 1 Million Corals</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/coral.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/coral-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/coral-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/coral-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1706" height="960"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they may look like plants, corals are actually animals. However, they contain plants and secrete minerals, so the confusion is understandable 😅</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr David Vaughan, PhD in Marine Sciences, wants to plant </span><a href="http://plantamillioncorals.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 million corals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thanks to an innovative technique he discovered by accident!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While moving coral samples in an aquarium, he accidentally broke one into small pieces that fell at the bottom of the aquarium. He thought these corals were lost and forgot about them. A few weeks later, he came back to the aquarium and noticed that they had not only survived but multiplied and grown. By pursuing his research, he discovered that small pieces of coral placed close to each other would grow together and fuse back as one piece.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this micro-fragmentation process, growth and healing happen up to 40 times faster than they occur naturally on the reef. It means that it could take only a couple of years to restore 100-year-old corals! David envisions using this innovative technique to reproduce resistant coral strains and recover the lost reefs.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With 25-40% already lost, the worldwide coral population is in incredible danger. They provide habitats for numerous fish (including Nemo and Dory!), and fisheries depend on them for up to 40% of their catch. Coral reefs are also the rainforests of the sea: they absorb heaps of carbon dioxide and produce a large amount of the oxygen we breathe. Finally, they protect the shorelines from waves and storms and help mitigate climate change effects.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time to find Nemo has passed. Now, let’s save his habitat 🐠</span></p><h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/africas-great-green-wall.html">The Guild’s Pick</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/gambia-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/gambia-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/gambia-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/30/responsive/gambia-2-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple NGOs are currently working on a mammoth project: Africa’s </span><a href="https://www.greatgreenwall.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great Green Wall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This African-led movement has the ambition to grow an 8,000km natural wonder of the world across the entire width of Africa. The goal is to create a barrier against climate change running across the Sahel region – from Senegal to Djibouti. The Sahel forms a transitional zone between the Sahara desert and the rainforest and is one of the poorest places on Earth.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once complete, the Great Green Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet, 3 times bigger than Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Since its beginning in 2007, this initiative brought food security, jobs and stability to locals. More than just growing trees and plants, the Great Green Wall is thus transforming millions of lives in the Sahel region. </span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, the region became virtually uncultivable due to climate change and deforestation. The lack of rainwater allows saltwater from the sea to move upstream and destroy crops. Moreover, without trees, the soil has lost all its nutrients, and crops don’t grow. This situation led to biodiversity loss, poverty, mass emigration, violence and food insecurity. The Great Green Wall isn’t just for the Sahel, though. It could contribute to solving the world’s pressing threats – notably climate change, drought, famine, conflict and migration.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: pioneerspost.com)</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">📌 Google </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/22/google-maps-recycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Google Maps would display featured businesses’ sustainable practices.
