Laura explains that, for most people, "it takes 7 to 12 years to start to move forward on helping yourself to hear better." Indeed, transitioning to their new situation takes a process that includes dealing with denial and finding a motivation to move forward.</p><p>"[My two boys] were probably the reason why I decided to go and do something about my hearing. They are often swearing at each other, and I will turn around and say, who started it? And they will point to each other. I wanted to catch them in the act. Also, I wanted to be able to read them bedtime stories and keep talking to them after we turned out the light. When I got my cochlear implant, that was life-changing."</p><h3>Hearing Loss Can Affect Us All</h3><p>Hearing loss can affect anyone, even people who do not go to a loud concert or experience a speaker's or an instrument's feedback, Laura says. Indeed, "an extended sound exposure above 80 dB can [also] be harmful to your hearing".<br>Also, she warns against prescribed and over-the-counter medication that can be ototoxic. "In some cases, it can damage your hearing permanently." <br><br>People like Laura, who lose their hearing progressively, "might gradually withdraw from situations that put [them] at a disadvantage", without necessarily realising it. Often, "[they] will pick up other ways of doing things [and] work around it".</p><h3>POW Hearing Solutions' Origin</h3><p>During her post-secondary studies, Laura experienced first-hand the difficulties of following an event and interacting with a group of people in real time with impaired hearing.</p><p>"They had this wireless sound system that the instructor wore and a microphone that they clipped on. So, I was able to sit within a range of 150 feet in the big auditorium and listen, like they were just right on my shoulder but, I was not able to get any of the questions asked by other students." She had to put several systems in place to capture the ongoing events and conversations.</p><p>After graduation, Laura experienced discrimination which prevented her from working properly.</p><blockquote><p>75% of people with a disability are unemployed, and I thought, where is the national outcry?</p></blockquote><p>It made her realise she could start her own business to provide her community with direct or indirect support to help them get a job.<br><br>She then thought that Ontario's disability law, "even though not widely enforced, can be an incentive for businesses to provide accessibility in certain situations."</p><p>Laura has built upon the knowledge she acquired during her studies and life experiences to offer multiple fit-for-purpose devices and services related to hearing loss. "If a business gets a request by somebody working with them to accommodate that person, to hear well at a live event with a large audience, for example, then they will come to [POW Hearing] to set that up for them." As a result, "people feel respected and cared for". </p><h3>The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on POW Hearing</h3><p>After COVID, she had to adapt to the new macro context by offering "<span class="lt-line-clamp__raw-line"><a href="https://powhearing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear window lip reader face masks</a>" to foster accessible communication. These masks also have the side effect of enabling human interactions and facilitate communication, even for people with perfect hearing.</span></p><blockquote><p>A lot of people are lowering their masks. This is negating every safety features put in place! If I am crossing the street, wearing this mask, I have people stop me and say, where did you get that?</p></blockquote><p>Laura is currently looking for funds and support with marketing. In the future, she is hoping that existing players in the hearing loss space will join her in her journey to help people in different situations.</p><h3>How Can We Support People With Hearing Loss?</h3><p>Laura highlights that one size does not fit all. For someone who has hearing loss, you can start by asking them what they need. "I can give you a list, but it is not going to work," she says.</p><p>Overall, if you look at how people can communicate with you, you should offer a way that does not involve them to hear. For instance, you should always provide an email address to contact you instead of a phone number only.</p><blockquote><p>People who have hearing loss can do everything that people who do not have hearing loss can do, except they cannot hear!</p></blockquote><hr><p>Thanks so much for reading this post.
