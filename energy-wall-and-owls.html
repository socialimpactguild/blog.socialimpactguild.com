The electricity can then power the building to which the wall belongs or go back into the national grid, generating a new revenue stream for the owner.</p><p>However, this device is not only aesthetically pleasing. Indeed, one wall is enough to cover the energy needs of an average American home. Moreover, deploying such walls along roads and highways would be highly effective, as they would benefit from the natural wind and the one generated by the trucks and cars passing by.</p><p>Joe is currently working with several manufacturers to help him develop and commercialize this exciting product.</p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Wind energy plays a significant part in reducing the world's dependency on fossil fuels. However, wind turbines for homes have encountered very slow uptake due, in part, to their intrusive physicality. As a result, wind turbines flourish mainly offshore, where nobody can see them. This situation leads to wasting potential energy sources in cities prone to strong winds, such as Wellington (New Zealand), Perth (Australia), Chicago or Boston (USA).</p><p>Joe's kinetic wall can be a gamechanger in these urban areas by covering all their energy needs.</p><h2><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI Emoji',sans-serif;">🦉</span> <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/owls-replace-pesticides-in-californian-wineries.html">The Owls That Replace Pesticides</a></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/owl-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/responsive/owl-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/responsive/owl-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/responsive/owl-2-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure>Today, 80% of Napa Valley winemakers use owls to control their rodent population, while less than 20% use rodenticide instead.<p></p><p>Farmers realized that they only needed to build nest boxes near their fields to attract owls and reap the benefits. For example, a farmer with 20 owl boxes can expect those owls to catch around 70,000 rodents per year — which represents a cost of 26 cents per rodent, against several dollars for traditional methods (e.g. trapping, rodenticide).</p><p>Replacing pesticides with barn owls for rodent control is part of a broader environmentally sustainable trend among Napa Valley farmers. Indeed, many also reduce their water consumption in the face of Californian droughts and plant perennial grass between rows to prevent the dangers of monoculture.</p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> For decades, Napa Valley's wineries relied on pesticides to prevent rodents from damaging their crops. However, this strategy, coupled with grapes-only monoculture and the usage of commercial fertilizer, generated a toxic taint in certain wines, demonstrating the need for more sustainable practices. In January 2021, California passed a law restricting rodenticides, but lobbying created a loophole for agricultural use.</p><p>Although still technically authorized, Napa's growers turned away from rodenticides because they understood that people and nature depend on each other to thrive. Also, they took this opportunity to make a few raptor friends along the way.</p><p>(source: <a href="https://baynature.org/article/raptors-rather-than-rodenticide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baynature.org</a>)</p><h2>🎯 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/how-metropolitan-france-grows-zero-carbon-exotic-produce.html">The Guild's Pick</a></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/bananas-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/responsive/bananas-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/responsive/bananas-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/117/responsive/bananas-2-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1920" height="1081"></figure>In France, <a href="https://www.lesartsverts-torreilles.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Les Arts Verts</a> grow tropical produce in greenhouses to reduce the carbon footprint associated with importing food from around the globe.<p></p><p>These pioneer farmers in the Pyrenees produce bananas, turmeric, passionfruit, mangos, and many other species that we usually find in La Réunion (a French department in the Indian Ocean). Their secret is to find species that can handle conditions colder than the tropics to flourish in European greenhouses.</p><p>Moreover, Les Arts Verts grow their food according to the organic certification ECOCERT. In particular, they cultivate their tropical produce in living spaces, using polyculture to keep the soil rich and increase biodiversity. Also, they do not heat their greenhouses but equip them with solar panels to put clean electricity back into the grid.</p><p>Finally, this farm collaborates with the greatest French chefs—including a Michelin-starred restaurant— to provide them with zero-carbon exotic products.</p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Bananas and mangos are among the preferred fruits in France. The country imports <a href="https://www.fruitlogistica.com/FRUIT-LOGISTICA/Downloads-Alle-Sprachen/Auf-einen-Blick/European_Statistics_Handbook_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3.4 million metric tons of fruit</a> every year, despite the vast amount of farms within its borders. However, importing 2 tons of products can generate 6 tons of carbon dioxide and its greenhouse gas equivalent.</p><p>Eco-conscious consumers in France will now be able to get their favourite tropical fruits while enabling the creation of local jobs and preventing adverse effects on the environment.</p><h2>🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide …</h2><p>💧 Alphabet's X lab recently <a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/sharing-project-h2e-with-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-sourced</a> the data, prototypes, software, and hardware documentation of its atmospheric water harvester, a device producing safe drinking water from air humidity.
