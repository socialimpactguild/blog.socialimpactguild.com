Under UV rays, this component absorbs and disperses light and heat, giving the spray its cooling ability.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the spray’s “photo catalytic technology” removes nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and other pollutants released by thermic vehicles. According to the company, 1 mile of sprayed pavement can have the same air quality benefits as planting 20 acres of trees.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities throughout the US are currently experimenting with this technology under the supervision of researchers at </span><a href="https://pavements.tti.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas A&amp;M University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, an early experiment at Orlando International Airport suggests that the spray could cut NOx pollution by half.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Heavily built-up areas often experience what is called the “</span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heat island effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” In these neighbourhoods - mostly located in low-income areas - heat absorption from buildings and pavement can leave the area up to 4.4 degrees hotter than areas with more trees and green spaces. With the current climate-change-induced heatwaves, this phenomenon could quickly become unsustainable for people who do not have the means to relocate to healthier places.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding trees and green spaces is a longer-term solution for tackling the heat island effect and making these neighbourhoods easier to inhabit. In the meantime, this spray technology can have major public health benefits and lower locals’ energy bills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-sunscreen-for-pavement-could-help-keep-cities-cool-1847214621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gizmodo.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p><h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/young-inventor-develops-a-microplastic-magnet.html">The Guild’s Pick</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/water.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/responsive/water-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/responsive/water-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/37/responsive/water-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1919" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fionn Ferreira, a chemistry student at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, wants to fight microplastic pollution with magnetic water.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His innovation, which won the 2019 Google Science Fair, consists of using a mix of magnetized iron oxide and vegetable oil to attract plastic particles. Then, he uses a magnet to remove this mixture <span class="background-details">– </span>alongside the microplastics, leaving the water as pristine as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After many experiments, Fionn realized that this method was 87% effective in removing microplastics of all sorts from water.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He now aims to scale this technology to have a tangible impact on global pollution. The idea is to capture microplastics from wastewater before it reaches the sea by building a capture system in water treatment and sewage facilities.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Studies estimate the ocean contains 8.3 million pieces of microplastic per cubic metre of water. These microplastics, virtually impossible to remove through filtration, end up in the global food chain and, ultimately, on our plates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fionn’s innovation is one of the various projects aiming to remove microplastic from our oceans.
