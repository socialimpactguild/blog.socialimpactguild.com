The CEO, Paul Rathnam, compares containers to cardboard boxes. “They take all of our cargo around the world, safely. And, they’re reusable,” he says. Like kids building new structures out of old boxes, Paul has been upcycling containers into usable spaces for many years.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modpools purchases single-use containers to make sure they’re as pristine as possible and uses them as building blocks for its pools. Since the construction happens beforehand in the company’s factory near Vancouver, the installation is typically completed within a day. Families can then enjoy luxury-looking pools and spas without the usual on-site burden of construction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company already installed about 800 pools across North America and has recently increased its production capacity as the pandemic drove people to make their homes more comfortable and spend their vacations in their backyard.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the </span><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-china-trade-deficit-causes-effects-and-solutions-3306277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US-China trade deficit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most containers carrying goods from China to America never return and are, therefore, left to rust when they are not recycled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modpools seized this opportunity to create a sustainable business that upcycles waste into luxury goods that families can use for decades.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90664136/this-company-recycles-shipping-containers-into-backyard-swimming-pools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastcompany.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p><h2 id="tulips"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌷 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/these-stylish-wind-turbines-generate-safe-and-reliable-energy-in-cities.html">The Wind Turbines That Are Also Pieces of Art</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/wind-tulips.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/wind-tulips-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/wind-tulips-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/wind-tulips-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="620" height="372"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dutch-American company </span><a href="https://flowerturbines.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower Turbines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creates elegant tulip-shaped wind turbines that pose no danger to wildlife and whose noise is undetectable to humans.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Daniel Farb, the company’s CEO, addressed these issues with patented aerodynamic innovations. While most wind turbines start at 3 m/s, the Wind Tulip is already producing 25-30 watts at this speed. Moreover, traditional turbines cannot be placed close together at the risk of interfering with each other. On the other hand, Wind Tulips drive wind tunnels into each other -- making their neighbours perform 20-50% better. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to these innovations, these good-looking turbines are extremely efficient (up to 40%, against 7-10% for their conventional counterparts), especially under slow wind and in limited spaces. They are, therefore, particularly adapted to urban settings.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind farms' opponents often cite noise and biodiversity concerns along with aesthetic issues. As a result, city residents do not leverage wind energy, despite its huge potential, and rely on solar power as a local source of clean energy. However, the latter doesn’t perform well at night or during the winter. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wind Tulips make wind energy available for everybody by allowing people to live and work next to them. Coupled with already existing solar energy sources, they could be the future of locally-produced urban clean energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">theguardian.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p><h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 <a href="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/the-bison-bridge-could-boost-biodiversity-in-the-us.html">The Guild’s Pick</a></span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/bison.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/36/responsive/bison-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Quad Cities, USA, the </span><a href="https://bisonbridge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bison Bridge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project aims to repurpose Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge on Interstate I-80 to create a wildlife crossing that provides safe passage for bison herds.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides saving Illinois millions in demolition costs, this initiative could also attract tourists to this somewhat overlooked part of the country. Indeed, the bridge would feature a prairie strip for the bison to roam as well as a pedestrian area including viewing stations and cafés.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is currently in the study and waiting for the approval of the State of Illinois and the Federal Highways Administration. If everything goes according to plan, the construction should begin in 2026 after the design and engineering phases. </span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bison was a key species for the Native American tribes as it provided them with food, clothing, shelter and was central to their cultural and spiritual belief systems. They also played a crucial part in the plains’ ecosystem until overhunting brought their numbers down to 300.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project is the perfect opportunity to educate the American people on the bison while improving biodiversity and boosting the local economy.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide…</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🥇 In Brussels, a team of scientists are mining gold and silver from the </span><a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/world/this-country-is-digging-in-sewage-to-find-millions-of-gold-and-silver-11629272188668.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city's sewage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
