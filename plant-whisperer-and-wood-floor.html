The technology, called GrowStream, uses tubes that can sense those chemicals and release water and nutrients through billions of “smart micropores.” Once the plants have had enough, they stop emitting the chemical, and the technology’s pores close until the plants need irrigation again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has installed this irrigation system in 14 different countries so far. For instance, in the dry areas of Pakistan, vegetables like tomatoes and bok choy grow 81% faster and twice as large than with regular drip irrigation. Also, in Los Angeles, RDI works with the city to irrigate green spaces while using 45% to 50% less water than drip irrigation.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water is more and more scarce around the globe because of global warming.
