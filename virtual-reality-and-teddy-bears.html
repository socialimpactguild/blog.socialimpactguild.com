So, he developed a game in cooperation with the software company </span><a href="https://appliedvr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied VR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and uses it with his young patients when they undergo medical procedures, such as IV preparation or bandages replacement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explains that pain highly depends on the context. Indeed, pain is more acute when we are stressed out or overly focused on it. But, on the other hand, our body produces natural endorphins, which are a neurochemical analgesic, when we’re having fun.</span></p><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/43/3/266/4558507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrate that VR <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> especially interactive games <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> is significantly more effective than any other distraction for pain management. Indeed, our brain is unable to tell the difference between a virtual and a real environment.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR can have a broad range of usages, from purely managing pain to eliminating anxiety or simply distracting a kid to make them stay still. Whatever the use case, it always reduces the need for drugs and prevents the associated side effects (e.g. adverse reaction, addiction). Also, using VR before surgeries can lead to shorter recovery times and better overall postoperative outcomes. Otherwise, nurses and doctors are more relaxed and are in better dispositions to do a great job.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a refreshing change of pace to see video games and technology being praised for their health benefits, especially when it means reducing the need for pain medication and sedation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(source: </span><a href="https://dot.la/virtual-reality-pain-management-2654980900.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dot.la</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p><h2 id="toys"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🐻 The Adoption Agency for Preloved Teddy Bears</span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/teddy-bear-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/teddy-bear-2-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1439" height="810"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, </span><a href="https://www.lovedbefore.london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loved Before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened a “soft toy adoption agency” to promote sustainability in the industry and give preloved toys a second life.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creator, Charlotte Liebling, witnessed the massive amount of toys donated and thrown away when she worked in a charity shop. Her social enterprise wants to encourage people to buy pre-owned soft toys and change the perceptions around second-hand items. Indeed, she asks previous owners to provide toys’ back story to add a sentimental value that brand new toys don’t possess.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meteoric success of this company <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> from 20 new toys per week last year to 1,000 today <span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">–</span></span> proves that people are now ready to change how they consume.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plush toy market is valued at around $10 billion and grows 7% each year. However, their production requires a large amount of water and energy, and most of the time, they include petrol-based polyester. Moreover, a </span><a href="https://www.charityretail.org.uk/british-heart-foundation-calls-on-parents-to-donate-unwanted-toys-this-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that 50% of children are tired of a new toy after only a week and 25% of parents throw away perfectly good items that end up in a landfill.</span></p><p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can donate our unused toys to charity, schools or social enterprises like Loved Before instead of throwing them away. This simple action will not only benefit the environment but also bring joy to other people.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies, such as LEGO or Mattel, also have toy recycling schemes.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, many cities worldwide feature toy hospitals that can repair and clean the toys we want to keep and pass on to the next generation.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Internet is full of DIY videos and posts that explain how to use old toys to build new furniture and decorative objects.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between a toy and its owner goes beyond the utilitarian aspect. Charlotte’s wholesome initiative enables perpetuating our memories while reducing the environmental footprint of the toy industry.</span></p><h2> </h2><h2 id="pick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">🎯 The Guild’s Pick</span></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/algae.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.socialimpactguild.com/media/posts/43/responsive/algae-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="851" height="479"></figure><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based organization </span><a href="https://www.ecologicstudio.com/projects/airbubble-playground-and-exhibition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed a children's play centre called AirBubble that uses algae in solar-powered bioreactors to remove pollutants from the air.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar energy powers photosynthesis by which algae split carbon dioxide into carbon, which it uses to feed, and oxygen, which it releases into the room. On the other hand, the children's play activates machinery that moves liquid through the bioreactors, ensuring proper aeration.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the designer, the system can filter up to 200 litres of air per minute and purify the entire structure in less than 24h, driving pollution levels down to within World Health Organization guidelines. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this process transforms pollutants into biomass, a raw material for bioplastics, food supplements, natural cosmetics and more. So, we ultimately end up with usable byproducts instead of waste.</span></p><p><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoLogicStudio chose to install AirBubble in Warsaw, Poland, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, to educate people about air quality in a playful way. Indeed, the link between urban air quality, respiratory health and public well-being has become more evident during Covid, and tackling this issue is crucial for our future. Also, the organization wants to inspire future generations to find innovative solutions for our current problems.</span></p><p><strong>How can we help? </strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In urban areas, most of our trips are less than a few kilometres long. Using public transportation, biking or walking for these trips can go a long way to reducing pollution. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using an electric vehicle is also highly effective.
